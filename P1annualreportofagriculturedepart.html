<p>Labor Conditions: The labor conditions during last season were very favorable, and this was the only feature during the entire season which was at all satisfactory. </p>
<p>On our property the largest amount of thinning was done by Hindoos. This work was done very well and reasonably cheap. We paid them 10 cts. an hour and from three to four men would thin an acre of beets in a day, although many times they put in 12 hours a day. The Fall work was also principally done by Hindoos, at first by the day and later on by the ton. The irrigation was also done by Hindoos and they have proven to be much better than any other labor we have been able to get for such work. Very few of them got sick, and they are stronger and more able to handle the shovel than the Japanese. Besides they are anxious to do their work as near right as possible. </p>
