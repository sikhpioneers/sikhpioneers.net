<p>December  3, 2005 - Faith, family and community are the central pillars around  which the lives of the Dr. Paramjit S. Everest family revolve.</p>
<p>The focus earned them the title of Sutter County Family of the Year in ceremonies at River Valley High School in Yuba City.
  <br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;I  thought we would go to the event and then leave quietly,&rdquo; a modest  Everest said afterward. &ldquo;This was really a humbling experience and a  positive experience, when there are so many negative experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  family of the 51-year-old Everest, a dentist in the area, are members  of the Yuba-Sutter Sikh community. He and his wife, Surinder K.  Everest, have three children - daughters Amarpreet, 15, and Harkiren,  9, and son, Harpreet, 20. His parents, Hari S. Everest, 89, and Amar K.  Everest, 81, live with the family in the Tierra Buena area at the west  edge of Yuba City.<br>
    <br>
 
  The sucess of the family goes back to his own upbringing, Everest said.<br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;When  I was a little kid, I had to do three things,&rdquo; Everest said. &ldquo;The first  was to take a bath. Next, there was a temple near our house and we had  to go and pay homage to the scripture. Then, when we came home, we were  served breakfast. That's why we want our kids to follow religion.  Religion offers a lot to our kids. It keeps them going in the righteous  path.<br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;I think the award is an honor, but not just for me or my  part in it, but for my whole family starting with my dad and mom's  involvement in the community, which inspires me to help the community.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
  Everest  is a volunteer for the annual Hershey track meet, coaches basketball,  helps out at the nearby Sikh Temple, is dental adviser to the area  Headstart program and is a past president and founding member of the  Punjabi American Heritage Society.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, coming home to his family is Everest's number one priority.<br>
    <br>
  &ldquo;I try to take extra time with my parents and kids. Family, I value that more&Scaron; the time I spend with them,&rdquo; he said.<br>
  <br>
  Surinder  Everest is a part-time school teacher and has made it a point, along  with her husband, to attend school, temple and community events family  members are involved in.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  A  worker in the literacy program at the Sutter County Library, she said  she encourages her children to do their best in everything they do for  themselves, the family and the community.<br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;I think families should stay together and support each other,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Son Harpreet is a junior at the University of California, Davis, where he is studying genetics and dentistry.<br>
    <br>
  &ldquo;I  just really admire my parents and my grandparents for all they have  done. All they do is with love and genuine care,&rdquo; he said.<br>
  <br>
  The Yuba City High School graduate said he hopes to follow in his father's footsteps.<br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;The  values that they have taught us I have upheld, even with the society we  live in. And especially in college where it so easy to lose them. My  entire family, including my dad and grandfather, has never used alcohol  or smoked. I'm proud to say I've done the same,&rdquo; he said.<br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;My  parents just did one heck of a job, especially balancing that with my  grandmother being sick,&rdquo; Harpreet continued. &ldquo;I've seen my dad in the  middle of the night taking care of her and feeding her. We could have  put her in a home but our family stepped up and we all came together  and said that is not what our family is about.&rdquo;</p>

Amarpreet Everest is active in sports and service clubs at Yuba City High School where she is a sophomore. She says she is inspired by other family members.<br>
<br>
“When I think of a family, I think of people who will love you no matter what. You do something bad; you do something awesome, they will love you no matter what. I think our family cares so much. My mom always wants me to be the best I can be. She inspires me to work harder,” she said.
<br><br>
Winner of a first place award for piano in the Tri-Counties Music competition, the active teen said she wants to become a doctor and attend Stanford. She admits being influenced in her choice of schools by her father and grandfather, who also attended Stanford, and by her grandmother, who today suffers from Alzheimer's and who is cared for by all family members.
<br><br>
“All those years she was caring for us. Now it's our turn for us to care for her,” she said.
<br><br>
“It was a big honor for us to be out there with all those other families,” she said of the Family of the Year awards. “I was listening to their stories, and I was just glad that our family was among them.”
<br><br>
One of several people who nominated the Everest family for the annual award was Siri Pritam Khalsa, who is impressed how the family has rallied around grandmother Amar Everest.
<br><br>
“You see, many of us would do the same for our parents - but to do it for so long - getting up every night, never complaining, looking only to God and to duty for inspiration - that to me is true Family of the Year material,” she wrote.
