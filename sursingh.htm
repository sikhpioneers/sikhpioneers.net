<P>SUR SINGH GADDARI BABA MEMORIAL SOCIETY has been established to ensure that 
the history of our ancestors in North America is properly and suitably preserved 
and appreciated. The contribution of Gaddari Babas must be understood and 
appreciated by all those who are desirous of a complete understanding of their 
role in the movement to liberate India starting in the early 1900s. At this 
time, it has been decided to highlight the contributions of the Gaddari Babas of 
Sur Singh. A plot of land in the District Amritsar, Punjab, India, has been 
obtained to build a memorial centre to advance the understanding and the 
appreciation of the Gaddari Baba's history of struggle for us. The memorial 
centre shall house a museum and a library where our future generations shall be 
able to learn about the lives of patriot-martyrs such as Jagat Singh and Prem 
Singh, both of Sur Singh. </P>
