<P>
	The end of colonial rule in India and the birth of two new nations-India and Pakistan-was 
celebrated in California in 1947 by immigrant men from India’s Punjab province.  Their wives 
and children celebrated with them.  With few exceptions, these wives were of Mexican ancestry 
and their children were variously called “Mexican Hindus,” an American misnomer for people 
from India.  In a photo taken during the 1947 celebrations in the northern California farm town of 
Yuba City, all the wives of the “Hindus” are of Mexican descent, save two Anglo women and 
one woman from India.
<P>
	There were celebrations in Yuba City in 1988. Too; the Sikh Parade (November 6) and 
the Old-Timers’ Reunion Christmas Dance (November !2).  Descendants of the Punjabi-
Mexicans might attend either or both of these events—the Sikh Parade, because most of the 
Punjabi pioneers were Sikhs, and the annual Christmas dance, because it began as a reunion for 
descendants of the Punjabi pioneers.  Men from India’s Punjab province came to California 
chiefly between 1900 and 1917; after that, immigration practices and laws discriminated against 
Asians and legal entry was all but impossible.  Some 85 percent of the men who came during 
those years were Sikhs, 13 percent were Muslims, and only 2 percent were really Hindus.
<P>	Marriages between Punjabis and Mexicans began in the second decade of the twentieth 
century.  Most descendants of these Punjabi-Mexican couples continue to refer to themselves as 
Hindus, and they are very proud of their Punjabi background.  Yet most descendants are 
Catholic, and while most are bilingual, they speak English and Spanish, not Punjabi.  An 
understanding of the ethnic choices made by the Punjabi-Mexican descendants requires an 
excursion into the history of their community.

<H4>The Punjabi immigrants
</H4>
	For decades, farming families had been sending sons out of the Punjab to earn money.  
Punjabis constituted a disproportionate share of the British Indian military and police services 
throughout the British Empire, in the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the China treaty 
ports.  Many of those who ended up in California had served overseas in the British Indian army 
or police in China and crossed the Pacific for the better wages in railroad, lumbering, and 
agricultural work.  On arrival in California, a few sold tamales from carts in San Francisco, but 
the majority began as migrant laborers, moving in groups around the state with a “boss man” 
who knew English and made contracts with employers.

<P>	

	Work and settlement patterns varied regionally in California, depending on the types of 
crops grown and the nature of the local population, both in terms of numbers and racial or ethnic 
composition.  Intending to return to India, only a handful of men had brought their wives and 
families; soon it was not possible to bring them.  In northern California’s Sacramento Valley, 
Punjabis tended to work in gangs, and were called “Hindu crews.”  Most of the Imperial Valley.  
Eventually, there were almost four hundred of these biethnic couples clustered in California’s 
agricultural valley.  Some 250 couples lived in the Imperial Valley in the south, some ninety 
couples lived in the Sacramento Valley in the north, and some fifty couples lived in the Central 
Valley around Fresno.
<P>	The Punjabi men chose women of Mexican ancestry for many reasons.  Mexican women 
were thought to resemble Punjabis physically, and many were beautiful.  Perhaps most 
important, Mexican women were accessible in southern California (in the central and northern 
areas of the state most of the Punjabi men remained bachelors).  Mexican families picked cotton 
in the fields farmed by the Punjabi men.  Mexicans and Punjabis shared a rural way of life; with 
similar types of food, furniture, and so on, they had a similar material culture.  Furthermore, 
Mexicans and Punjabis shared an initially lower-class status.
<P>	These marriages were more than a matter of individual choice, however, for the fact was 
that miscegenation laws prohibited marriages across racial lines in California until 1948.  Most 
California county clerks saw the Punjabi men as colored, or “brown,” the word they used most 
often on the marriage license to describe the men’s race.  Thus the women the Punjabis married 
also had to be perceived as “brown,” and that generally meant women off Mexican ancestry.
<p>	Ethnic similarities between the men and women were most striking at the time these 
marriages began to occur.  Like Mexicans, Punjabis were discriminated against by white society.  
At least half of the women, like the men, were pioneers in a new country and came from a group 
entering the agricultural economy as laborers.  A wave of Mexican migration into the United 
States was just beginning in the decade of the 1910s, fueled by the Mexican Revolution and its 
attendant political and economic turmoil.  
<P>
	In Texas and California, where cotton was being cultivated by Punjabi men with the help 
of Mexican immigrant laborers, the growing number of biethnic couples began to constitute a 
biethnic community with certain characteristic features.  The women were usually much younger 
than their husbands – the men were typically in their thirties and forties, and the women were in 
their teens and twenties.  The women were almost all Catholic, but most marriage  ceremonies 
were civil.  The signatures of brides and grooms alike testify to a low level of literacy.  Husbands 
and wives spoke to each other in rudimentary English or Spanish.  Punjabi men learned Spanish 
to deal with Mexican agricultural laborers and to speak to their wives.  Some Punjabi men 
adopted Spanish names or nicknames:  Miguel for Magyar, Andreas for Inter, Mondo for 
Mohamed.
<P>
	The Punjabi-Mexican marriage pattern soon became well established.  The first brides 
recruited other women, their relatives and friends, for marriages with Punjabi men.  Sisters with 
small children who had been deserted or widowed were called from Mexico to marry Punjabis.  
The men traveled too.  A Sikh from the Imperial Valley took the train to El Paso, Texas, looking 
for the nieces of a Mexican woman working for him.  He knocked on the wrong door, and the 
mother and three daughters on the other side mistook him at first for a Turk because of his 
turban.  But in a few days, he and his new bride, her mother, and sisters were on the train back to 
El Centro.  The Sikh’s partners married the other sisters and eventually the mother also married a 
Punjabi Sikh.  This was a typical pattern—many sets of sisters or female relatives married 
business partners and formed joint households along the irrigation canals and country roads.
<P>
	The birth of children brought a stronger sense of community and a shift of domestic 
power to the women.  Almost without exception, the children were given Spanish names.  
(Rarely, a father filed an affidavit of correction later, giving a son a Punjabi name.  Some divorce 
cases showed that names were a source of conflict:  The fathers used Punjabi names for their 
children, the mothers, Spanish.)  Another strengthening of the women’s network came with the 
appropriation of the compadrazgo system of fictive kinship, which drew upon relatives and 
friends as religious sponsors in the Catholic church.  Punjabi men stood as godfathers to each 
other’s children in this basically Catholic system, but it was the women who were central to it.
<P>
	How were children, given names like Maria Jesusita Singh, Jose Akbar Khan, and 
Armando Chand, socialized, and how did they think of themselves?  Contrary to Yusuf 
Dadabhay’s theory that the Punjabis assimilated to American culture by way of the Mexican-
American subculture, the Punjabi-Mexican families did not participate in activities with 
Mexican-Americans nor were they well received by members of that community.   Mexican men 
opposed these marriages, and there were some early instances of violence between Punjabis and 
Mexicans  over them.  While some Punjabi men were close to their Mexican relatives by 
marriage, most were not.
<P>
	These biethnic families formed communities of their own, and families visited across 
county and state lines (there were small numbers of Punjabi-Mexican families in Arizona, Texas, 
New Mexico, and Utah, too).  The partnerships and friendships of the Punjabi men were the basis 
of these interactions, but there was a double structure; often the wives of given sets of business 
partners or friends were sisters or related to each other in some other way.  So both male 
friendships and female kinship structured family life.
<P>
	Yet it was clearly the mothers who socialized the children.  The children spoke to their 
mothers in Spanish and to their fathers in English and/or Spanish.  A few of the boys who 
worked in the fields with Hindu crews learned some Punjabi; sometimes these boys were 
Mexican stepsons.  Most of them were raised as Catholics, and the fathers left this to the mothers 
and encouraged it.  The fathers had neither the time nor the training to teach their children about, 
Islam, or Hinduism.  The children had godparents who sponsored them at baptism, confirmation, 
and marriage in the Catholic Church—even though most godfathers were from the community 
and were Sikhs, Muslims, or Hindus.  These children met with prejudice from both Anglos and 
from Mexicans-—they were called “dirty Hindus” and “half and halves.”  Their favorite day was 
Sunday, when Punjabi men and their families got together for talk, play, and a dinner of chicken 
curry and roti (bread).  They liked going to the Stockton Sikh temple or working the migratory 
labor route, because they could meet others like themselves.
<P>
	The fathers transmitted little of Punjabi culture to their wives and children, save in the 
domains of food and funeral practices.  Cooking in the home drew from both Mexican and 
Punjabi cuisine and the men taught their wives to cook chicken curry, roti, and various vegetable 
curries.  Today, the Rasul family in Yuba City runs the only Mexican restaurant in California 
that features chicken curry and roti.  Another important retention of Punjabi culture was the 
disposition of the body upon death.  Sikhs insisted upon cremation, then uncommon in North 
America, and Muslims carried out orthodox burial ceremonies for each other (though the plots in 
which they are buried in rural California are termed “Hindu plots”).  The wives, however, were 
buried in the Mexican Catholic section of local cemeteries, as were the children.
<H4>Constructions of ethnicity
</H4>

Most of the Punjabi descendants refer to themselves as Hindu or East Indian today.  
When they talk about being Hindu, these descendants do not mean objective criteria that link 
them to India or the Punjab—attributes such as those an anthropologist might list.  They are 
fundamentally ignorant of Punjabi and Indian culture.  For example, while most of the men who 
founded these families were actually Sikhs, not Hindus, their descendants (and even the 
descendants of Muslim Punjabis) proudly claim to be Hindu.  These descendants are almost all 
nonspeakers of Punjabi and have no sense of the Punjab’s distinctive regional culture.  They have 
a sense of place and history, however, and they possess a heritage that is distinctly Punjabi 
nonetheless.
<P></P>One of the reasons descendants claim more strongly to be Hindu rather than Mexican is a 
negative one—to be Mexican in California’s agricultural towns is to affiliate with the laborer, not 
the landowner, class—but there are other, positive reasons for claiming to be Hindu.  There is 
some identification with place and locality in the spatial sense, a belief that California’s 
agricultural valleys resemble the Punjabi homeland (certainly the fathers promulgated this view).   
<P></P>There were other perceptions (or creations) of similarities that the men expressed about their new 
lives and that their descendants continue to voice.  These other perceived similarities, the senses 
in which the descendants in California today feel themselves to be Punjabi, to be Hindu, include 
their place in the political system and their ideas about Punjabi and Mexican material culture, 
language, and religion.
<P></P>The original Punjabi immigrants found the physical landscape of California similar to 
that of the Punjab; the political landscape and their place in it also struck them as similar to that 
in British India.  The men’s resentment at being colonial subjects as  well as their resentment at 
being deprived of legal rights in the United States is strongly evident in all contemporary 
accounts.  The Punjabi men organized the militantly nationalist Ghadar Party in California to 
fight against the British back in India; they contributed money, and some of them went back to 
participate in Ghadar party activities there.  They fought hard for political rights here, too, 
organizing groups and supporting lobbyists to gain U.S. citizenship.  They interpreted both their 
past and present as a struggle for one’s rightful place in society, particularly a place on the land, a 
very important component of Punjabi identity.
This interpretation has continuing meaning to their children, most of whom still live and 
work in agricultural valleys in California.  They too feel strong resentment for being looked 
down upon as “half and halves,” for being pushed into the Mexican and black schools, and, most 
of all, for not having the land today that their fathers “really earned” but were  unable to acquire 
easily because of the <A HREF="legis.html#alien">Alien Land Law</A>.  Passionate resistance to the political authority that 
subordinated them linked the fathers to each other in the past, and it links their descendants to 
their fathers and to each other today.
<P>
Central to the sense of continuing Punjabi identity is the question of how the marriages 
with Mexican women—women perceived today by new Indian immigrants as decidedly different 
from them—are viewed.  Rather than emphasize (or even mention) the miscegenation laws that 
played a major role in determining their choice of spouses, the men and their descendants, when 
interviewed, talk about commonalities between the Punjabi men and Mexican women.  They do 
not argue that they occupied the same space in the social landscape; that would go against the 
general Punjabi sense of superiority to Mexicans that carried over from their landowner status in 
the Punjab.  They do argue that there were similarities of physical appearance and even of 
language (“Spanish is just like Punjabi, really”); they argue also that Mexicans and Punjabis 
shared the same material culture.  As Moola Singh of Selma, California, who has thirteen 
children from three marriages with Mexican women says: 
<blockquote>
 I never have to explain anything India 
to my Mexican family.  Cooking the same, only talk us different.  I explain them, customs in 
India same as in Mexico.  Everything same, only language different.  They make roti over there, 
sit on the floor—all customs India the same Mexico, the way of living.  I went to Mexico two, 
three times, you know, not too far; just like India, just like it.  Adobe houses in Mexico, they sit 
on floor there, make tortillas (roti you know).  All kinds of food the same, eat from plates 
sometimes, some places tables and benches.  India the same, used to eat on the floor, or cutting 
two boards, made benches.
</blockquote>
<P></P>The women came from a similar material culture, it seems, but what about the religious 
differences?  The men and their descendants state repeatedly that all religions are the same, a 
view again in sharp contrast to that expressed by more recent immigrants from India.  The 
statements take different forms:  The Sikh religion is just like the Catholic one; Sikhism is a 
composite of Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity; the Granth Sahib is just like the Bible; all goods 
are the same, but they are called different names because languages are different; Sikhism has the 
ten cruz, or ten crosses which are the ten gurus; the founding Sikh guru preached just what is in 
the Old Testament; Sikhs have all the commandments Catholics have; one can be Muslim and 
Catholic or Sikh and Catholic at the same time.
Ignoring religious differences now significant in India, these statements stress similarities 
between the Indian religions and Christianity, frequently using metaphors and analogies to erase 
distinctions.  While there were many vigorously contested matters between pioneer Punjabi 
husbands and Mexican  wives, the children’s religious training was not one of them.  The men 
wanted to inculcate respect for Sikhism, Hinduism, or Islam, while they encouraged their 
children to practice Catholicism (or whatever form of Christianity their wives practiced).
<P></P>Even as the Punjabi men talk about the similarities between their homeland and 
California, upon which they base their continuing collective identity – geography and landscape, 
the struggle for one’s rightful social and political place, wives from a background materially and 
culturally similar to their own—they also talk about things that are different, particularly social 
practices that were not appropriate to their new country.  Most mention behaviors conditioned by 
caste and religion back in India, but they usually behave or advocate behaving differently in 
California.  While they point out the Untouchables in their midst (most immigrants were Jat 
Sikhs, a landowning caste), the Untouchables socialize with the others on a daily basis—
chatting, for example, in Holtville Park during the midday rest.  The Punjabi men also remark on 
prohibited Sikh-Muslim-Hindu interactions in India, but men from all three religions generally 
work, eat, and socialize together in California.  When talking to their wives and children about 
religion, as we have seen, the husbands reconceptualize differences as similarities at a higher 
analytic level.
<P>
The original Punjabi immigrants refused to transmit elements of Punjabi culture that they 
judged inappropriate in the United States, according to their children.  Many fathers felt that the 
immigration laws and other discriminatory policies against Asians had made it useless to teach 
the children Punjabi, or even to tell them about Punjabi society.  Social practices from the 
Punjab, life cycle ceremonies, and caste and religious distinctions and observances, were 
consciously discarded; when interviewed, several children remarked on their father’s refusal to 
talk to them about the Punjab, refusals justified by the uselessness of such knowledge and by the 
need to become American.  Of course, some fathers resurrected the ghosts of caste, sect, and 
region from their pasts as their children began to date and marry.  But since they had not taught 
their wives and the children the importance of these distinctions earlier, their concerns came too 
late.  As one indignant wife defended her daughter’s right to date someone:  “We’re all 
Americans here—what is this caste thing?”

<H4>Ethnic choices
</H4>
The children grew up, therefore, with a collective identity that drew upon two cultural 
traditions, and they drew upon both in making ethnic choices.  There were occasions for choice, 
some posed by the individual life cycle.  As they grew up and began dating (parents permitting), 
they could date and marry older Punjabi men, Anglos, Mexican-Americans, or others like 
themselves.  Most married Anglos or Mexican-Americans.  They could profess Christianity 
(most) or Islam (a few), or they could feel themselves to be both Christian and Sikh, Muslim, or 
Hindu at the same time (many).
<P>
As they left the Imperial Valley and other places where they were known, they were 
given new labels.  One man had been called Mexican-Hindu all his life by everyone, including 
state authorities in the Imperial Valley.  Working near Sacramento when the United States 
entered World War II, he enlisted in military service there, giving his race as “Hindu and 
Mexican.”  The clerk listed him as Caucasian despite his protests; this was a shock to him, an 
introduction to a wider world, and in some sense, a loss.
<P></P>Other ethnic choices were posed by external circumstances, perhaps the most important 
being the independence of India and Pakistan in the late 1940s and the changed U.S. immigration 
law in 1965.  The independence and partition of India and Pakistan in 1947 brought tremendous 
pride and pleasure to the old Punjabis in the United States, men long deprived of meaningful 
citizenship in any country.  As we have seen, the wives and children of the Sikhs and Hindus 
celebrated Indian independence; further, the families of the Muslim Punjabi immigrants renamed 
themselves Spanish-Pakistanis.  Again their choices emphasized the South Asian heritage.  Yet it 
has become increasingly difficult for these descendants of the early Punjabis to claim Hindu 
status in the face of the new immigrant populations from South Asia.
<P></P>The arrival of many new South Asian immigrants after the 1965 liberalization of U.S. 
immigration law has changed the context dramatically, and the descendants of the old-timers 
have had to sharpen and defend their ethnic choices.  Thousands of the newcomers—most of 
them—are educated professionals coming from all over South Asia.  Some, however, are Punjabi 
villagers much like the earlier immigrants, coming from the very same villages and settling in the 
same rural areas of California where descendants of the pioneers reside.  What are the 
descendants’ perceptions of these recent immigrants, and have those perceptions affected their 
claim to Hindu ethnicity?

<P></P>The problem is most acute in Yuba City, where aging bachelor Punjabis have sponsored 
many new immigrants and where chain migration has brought the new immigrant population up 
to about ten thousand.  In the Imperial Valley, there are many more Punjabi-Mexicans, and very 
few new immigrants from South Asia.  The Punjabi-Mexican descendants in the Yuba City area 
welcomed the first few newcomers and contributed to the building of the first Sikh gurdwara 
(temple) in Yuba City.  One of two benches at the gurdwara entrance reads “In loving memory of 
our father Harnam Singh Sidhu, 1891-1974, from children Isabel S. Villasenor, Ray S. Sidhu, 
Frank S. Sidhu, Pete S. Sidhu, Beatrice S. Myers.”
But by the mid-1970s, the two groups were diverging fast;  the newcomers disapproved 
of and minimized the Punjabi-Mexican marriages that had occurred and would not acknowledge 
the descendants’ claims to membership in the same community.  One anthropologist reports that 
Punjabi wives objected to the other wives cooking in the gurdwara, suspecting that the food was 
being poisoned.  Even if the story is untrue, it is significant that it is being told, and the fact is 
that few Punjabi-Mexican descendants visit the gurdwara for any reason today.
<P></P>In both the Stockton Sikh temple and the Muslim mosque started in Sacramento in 1947, 
the old and new immigrant communities jostle uneasily.  Spanish-Pakistani descendants do not 
like the practice of gender segregation instituted by the new immigrants from Pakistan, and the 
old Sikhs and their descendants find new practices in the Sikh temple similarly objectionable.  
Moola Singh gives a vivid description of the changes and his reaction to them:
<blockquote>
About our churches here, everybody went to the Stockton one, at least if they lived close 
by there, you know.  Hindu, Muslim, everybody went.  Afterwards, these days now, I don’t know 
what they’re doing….One thing I don’t like, not for that new group, not everybody can go.  
Before, the Hindu men married women here.  You know, everybody married white women, 
everybody married Mexican women, everybody went to church.  And our people, everybody 
went and sat on chairs.  That was before, not now.  Then, everybody could sit on a chair.  And 
for food, they gave it on a plate, with a spoon, and paper to clean your hands.  But after that, 
some Indian farmers and preachers have come.  They want all the customs like India, and they’ve 
taken away the chairs, put people back on the floor again.
<P>

I went with my wife one time to Stockton, where they have lots of chairs in back.  Me 
and my wife, we got a couple of chairs, we sat in the back.
“All right man, sit on the floor, all right man, sit on the floor,” someone said to us.  
I don’t care, people like that, people from India, why not have a church like other 
churches in this country?  These India people are damn fools.  Why have a church like before, 
why sit on the floor, why have no chairs, why have nothing?  Today, it’s different, twenty or fifty 
years have passed and today it’s different.
</blockquote>
<P></P>As Moola Singh points out, the pioneer immigrants and their descendants have adopted 
new ways appropriate to their new country, and they view the reimposition of South Asian 
customs  as unwelcome and backward-looking.  As the new Punjabi immigrant population has 
increased, tension over such issues has increased as well.
In 1974, the Punjabi-Mexicans initiated their Old-Timers’ Reunion Christmas Dance, 
billing it as a reunion for descendants of the Punjabi pioneer and publicizing it to bolster their 
claims of South Asian descent.  Yet from the first, the dance betrayed the double ethnic identity 
of its sponsors, featuring mariachi bands and exuberant dancing, and including Mexican-
American friends and relatives.  In 1979,  the new immigrant Sikh community began its annual 
Sikh Parade, a militant-looking march through Yuba City by hundreds (some say thousands) of 
Sikh men, women, and children in Punjabi dress led by bearded, turbaned men with drawn 
swords.  This first parade aroused local apprehension and prejudice, feelings already present 
because of the very successful Punjabi peach farmers and their acquisition of orchard land in the 
area.  Increasing prejudice against the new immigrants from India made it somewhat less 
desirable to claim Hindu status, yet descendants persisted.  One such woman, <A HREF="t_usphot.html#msr">Isabel Singh 
Garcia</A>, published a long letter entitled “They Are Too Hindus” in the local paper.
The descendants’ strategy now is to claim not only to be real Hindus, but better 
Americans than the newcomers.  They draw attention to the differences between their fathers and 
the new Punjabi immigrants.  These differences begin with physical appearance and manner of 
self-presentation:  They say their fathers were big men, commanding, proud, and light-skinned, 
while the newcomers are small, obsequious, deferential, and dark-skinned.  (This may have some 
basis in reality:  Many of the pioneers had served in the British military and police services, 
which had such physical requirements for enlistment.)  Attitudinal and behavioral differences—
ways in which the newcomers are not becoming American as the old-timers did—are stressed as 
well.
<P>The descendants of the Punjabi pioneers now avoid the Sikh Parade.  They still hold their 
annual Christmas dance, but its character has changed.  The dance has broadened its constituency 
to include all who went to school with the founders of the dance in Yuba City; it is now called 
the Old-Timers’ Dance and the organizing committee is primarily Mexican-American. In 1988 
only two of the eight organizers and about one-tenth of those attending were descendants of 
Punjabis or related to them by marriage.  The theme was Hawaiian, with “Aloha” written on a 
banner above the band platform.  The invitation began, “Hello/Ohio/Buenos Dias,” emphasizing 
cultural pluralism and the claim to be American.  Those who attended this rousing evening with 
its lively band and delicious Mexican dinner did tell stories about the pioneer couples, mimicking 
the broken English of the men from India, but the dance itself was a thoroughly American affair, 
albeit with a Mexican-American tinge.
The ethnic choices made by the Punjabi-Mexican-American pioneers remind us sharply 
that collective social identity entails some form of self-definition founded upon a marked 
opposition between “we” and “others.”  Changing contexts, changing local configurations of 
“we” and “others,” stimulated the “old Hindus” and their descendants to make ethnic choices to 
reconstruct their sense of place and society as they made this land their own.  The contribution of 
the Punjabi-Mexican-American families of California, chicken curry and tamales aside, 
ultimately lies in their demonstration of the flexibility of ethnicity, both its grounding in a 
specific political economy and its responsiveness to situational factors that allow individuals and 
groups to make ethnic choices.
