<p> Swami Triguanatita Expounds the Views of His Sect to a Large Crowd. <br>
    <br>
  Under the auspices of the Rama-Krishna Mission, Behr Math, Calcutta, the first Hindu temple in the western world was dedicated last night. The temple, which is situated at Filbert and Webster streets, is the meeting place of the San Francisco Vedanta Society, which was organized by Yogin Sawmi Vivekananda in the spring of 1900. The auditorium of the temple was packed to the doors last night by members of the society and their friends who had come to witness the dedication exercises. The only speaker was Swami Trigunatita, teacher of the society, and who designed the building. In his dedication address he told of the history of the society here and explained the views of the sect of which he is an exponent. He said that a person of Western environments, can be a Vedantist or Hindu by being very sincere in actions and thoughts; by giving entire freedom of thought and action to all the faiths and religions of the world, whether they be modern, orthodox or "reformed." The main and primary principle of Hinduism, according to the speaker, is to follow any path of faith suitable to one's own self, very sincerely, and with an ardent view of mental, moral, and spiritual development. An orchestra composed of members of the society rendered "Love's Repose," and the Intermezzo from "Cavalleria Rusticana," during the passing of envelopes in which the members were to make their dedicatory offerings. After the service, which concluded with the singing of "America," all were invited to inspect the temple, and most of the audience took advantage of the invitation. The style of architecture of the new temple is generally called pointed, of Grecian and Roman origin. The point of the domes, towers and pinnacles, turning upward to the sky, have a religious meaning, according to the sect; and that is-- coming up nearer to God, or rising higher and higher until the very highest is reached. All the moldings and ornaments applied in the building are of Moorish style. The arches of the verandah are also of Moorish origin. The little wooden columns on which the arches rest, have Dorie bases and inverted Moorish caps. <br>
