Without bread and without water we have made our beds in the sea. Though we have spent hundreds of thousands in cash, yet suffering has been our daily lot. We have faced and repulsed armed men who came to kill us, tho&rsquo; we were without arms. Four centuries we have been enslaved yet we have shown the world that the military spirit still remains. We have seen the tyrannical spirit of our rules and withnessed their confusion too. After our struggle we left for home. We counted Japan as our friend and yet her attitude gave us anxiety. We warned Japan not to confide in our rules for they were black reptiles.</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style10"><strong> After distressing vicissitudes we came to the lap of our motherland. Scenes of abject poverty and oppression aroused our spirit, and with a lively recollection of our treatment, we gave our enemies palpitating hearts. From a deep sleep we awaked our countrymen. The tyrants army came to kill us but our eyes were open and we escaped their snare. The aim of the police was to capture our Sardar (Gurdit Singh) but we anticipated their trick. </strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style10"><strong> The time was when we as a garden of blooming roses but autumn came and the roses faded. The time was when we were shining in the sky but now our sun is under the clouds. The time was when we were happy in the mist of our family but now we are removed from home and all its joys. For India we have sacrificed our lives. It is by actions and not by talks that the mutiny can be participated (precipitated? Ed.) We have grown up with India&rsquo;s blood coursing in our veins and we pour out that blood for our mothers. Cowardly Indians have been dying as dogs but we have taught them how to die as heroes. We are sons of lions, living as lions, at least we have punced as lions. From disue our swords have gathered rust, but that rust we have put into the chest of our enemy. Foreigners have robbed our country but we have awaked India from a deep sleep. Our garden wilted without water, but we have irrigated it with our blood. Thou hast nourished us with thy sweet milk, O Mother, and now we given our blood for thee. We have sounded the bugle call and the scattered forces are gathering. Death awaits u all, but when we know not; if it should come in heroic deeds don&rsquo;t fear it. Arise! Arise! All ye who have a part in this war of deliverance. Don&rsquo;t say again the time is gone. We will not meet you again. The enemy&rsquo;s wounds are fresh, let them never heal &ndash;the blood is flowing, let it never dry up. Oye millions of India, witness our action and follow our example. Our body may be pierced with bullets, but the enemy will be torn up by the roots. </strong></p>

      <p align="left" class="style10"><strong> Dear Editor, </strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style10"><strong> Will you kindly give some space in your paper to the following few lines: </strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style10"><strong> Yesterday nigh at one O&rsquo;clock Immigration attacked th steamer Komagata Maru with four hundred armed policemen to take away the Maru forcibly form the Harbour. 30 minutes before their arrival their coming was informed by the official interpreter Mr. Hopkinson, who told that better you youself make the steamer to make otherwise 500 policemen fully armed are coming who will force on the boat and if any Hindoo oppose will be killed. Hearing this the watchmen woke up all their fellow passangers to face coming Black Uniformists. We keep our watchmen from 2 days being informed by Supdt of Immigration that police will forcibly drive the steamer out. All Hindoos on Maru, numbering 352, came on deck and formed firing lines. The boat of police reached alongside the Maru and saw the Hindoos standing all around by means of electric light. The police tied their boat with Maru with a strong rope. The Hindoos cut down their rope with a sharp knife. The police made noise and they fired their guns but useless. Then they sprinkled water by means of water pipe but Hindoos did not care a bit and began to throw upon them coal. When all Hindoos did threw coal and shouted loudly the Police brain did not work and went inside their boat running &ndash; that scene was a nice one. Many of them lost their caps which floated on the sea. They hurried to take back their boat. Hindoos have also received severe wounds by the police, but Black Uniformists returned with shame and Hindoos shouted loudly &ldquo;Sat Sri Ala;&rdquo; which means &ldquo;God help&rdquo;. </strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style10"><strong> We don&rsquo;t know the reason of the foolish act of the police which attacked the steamer and wished to clear it forcibly without the consent of the charterers ashore. The Japanese crew did not come out of their cabins and were too much frightened when firing of guns and noise etc. The police returned unsuccessful. He who will give it to the papers shall be highly thanked. </strong></p>
