  <p><font size="4"> Angel Island is the lesser-known sibling of the more famous 
    Ellis Island of the Atlantic seaboard. Where Ellis Island processed immigrants 
    crossing the Atlantic, the Angel Island Immigration Station, located in the 
    middle of the San Francisco Bay, was often the first stop for any immigrant 
    crossing the Pacific. Between 1910 and 1940, hundreds of thousands of immigrants, 
    from places such as China, <a href="t_usphot.html#angel">India</a>, Japan, 
    and Korea were stationed, quarantined, questioned, and processed at this once 
    forgotten historical site. Echoes of their journeys and trials going through 
    Angel Island are recorded in the walls themselves where writing, names, and 
    even poetry is found, left behind by passing travelers.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">For more information, including the ongoing project to restore 
    and preserve this historic site, visit the AIISF (Angel Island Immigration 
    Station Foundation) at <a href="http://www.aiisf.org">http://www.aiisf.org</a>

  <p><a href="http://groups.haas.berkeley.edu/iber/casefiles/chinese_immigrants_data_entry.cfm">Early 
    Arrivals Records Search (EARS)</a> is a database for the records of immigrants 
    and American-born Asians who arrived in San Francisco and Hawaii between 1882 
    and 1955. The current version is an index of the earliest 39,000 files in 
    the National Archives' collection; over time it will grow to include all 250,000 
    files held at the National Archives branch in San Bruno, CA. Of Indian origin 
    were 127 of the persons in the present database who tried, successful or not, 
    to enter the United States in the late 19th or early 20th century through 
    San Francisco or Hawaii. The database supplies a way to search for a particular 
    individual or group of people. This database is maintained by <a href="mailto:barde@haas.berkeley.edu">Bob 
    Barde</a>, Academic Coordinator at the Institute of Business and Economic 
    Research, at U.C. Berkeley. <br>
    <br>
    Examples of the information contained within these records are:</p>
  <p>&quot;<i>Statement Taken From Madho Ram, or Mado Ram, to determine status 
    ...</i></p>
  <p><i>Q:What is your name? A: Madho Ram; it is sometimes spelled Mado Ram.<br>
    Q: Where were you born? A: In the village of Jadla, District of Jullundur, 
    Province of Punjab, India.<br>
    Q:When did you first come to the United States? A: In 1913<br>
    Q: What date in 1913? A: I think maybe July or August. Maybe it was July 29, 
    1913, that I reached San Francisco. I lived three months in Quarantine. My 
    case was handled in San Francisco. I won the case after about two years. The 
    first two times I lost and appealed the case and finally the third time won 
    the case after two years.</i>&quot;<br>

          This is an online version, provided by Lou Amalfi, of a 1917 book written 
          by the woman missionary Mary Bramford. The book describes the processing 
          of immigrants through Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay. Of special 
          interest is Chapter V, &quot;Immigrants from India.&quot; The book is 
          informative and well intentioned, but full of the conceits of the age.</p>
