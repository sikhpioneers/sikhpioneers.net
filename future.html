  for the Gadar Heritage Foundation</FONT></B></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT size="2"><B><FONT size="3">1) </FONT></B><FONT size="3">In order to build 
  or create any type of memorial for the men and women who founded, supported, 
  and fought for the Gadar Party, it is necessary that a site for this memorial 
  is selected. It is preferred that this site be in the Greater Sacramento Area 
  as the first Sikh immigrants to arrive to the United States came in this region. 
  Also, numerous important meetings were held in the Central Valley, and a large 
  community of people recognize this fact.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size="3">2) Once a site has been selected, proper support must be achieved 
  from the community and surrounding regions. This support must be both financial 
  and mutually beneficient. Members must volunteer their time and efforts to create 
  a method of remembrance for the Gadarites. This will require devoted individuals 
  who understand the importance of conserving the culture and heritage.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size="3"><B>3) </B>After the previous two points are complete, then there 
  will be sufficient funds and cooperation to build a Gadar Heritage Memorial. 
  The Memorial should serve as a learning mechanism for youth and others that 
  are not familiar with the struggles of the Gadar Movement. Furthermore, the 
  Memorial should serve as a community center for functions, lectures, picnics, 
  etc. It should bring the community closer together by showing tribute to the 
  men and women of the Gadar Party.</FONT></P>
