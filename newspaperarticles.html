<p><strong><font size="4">Komagata Maru 'revolutionists'</font><br>
  </strong><em>Chandigarh, May 30</em></p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Court 
  today issued notice on the Public Interest Litigation seeking directions to 
  the Union of India to include the names of Komagata Maru 'revolutionists' in 
  the list of freedom fighters. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his petition, 
  Advocate Malwinder Singh Waraich submitted that Schedule 1 of Swatantra Sainik 
  Samman Pension Scheme does not include these revolutionists for award of pension, 
  which should be done immediately. Going into the background of the case, he 
  mentioned that Komagata Maru was a ship which carried 372 Indians to Canada 
  in 1914. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they were 
  refused entry in the ship from May 21, 1914 to July 25, 1914. They were later 
  provided ration for the return journey, following which the ship arrived in 
  Kolkata on September 29, 1914. They were fired at on their return and several 
  of them got injured while being arrested. Later, they were arrested and jailed. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking up the petition, 
  the court issued notice of motion for July 23. <br>
  <br>

<p><strong><font size="4">Notice to Union Government</font></strong><br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The division bench 
  of chief justice Binod Kumar Roy and justice Vigyan Mohan Jain have issued notice 
  to the Union government for July 23, on a writ petition filed by Malwinder Jit 
  Singh Waraich, seeking freedom fighters benefits for the legal heir of the Kamagata 
  Maru ship incident of 1914, where a number of Indians had sailed to Canada but 
  were refused entry. On return to India, majority of them died or suffered at 
  the hands of the British. Though the contribution Kamagata Maru martyrs in the 
  freedom struggle could hardly be over-emphasized, they were acknowledged in 
  1975 when the site for the All India Congress Committee session held at Mataur 
  near Mohali was named after Kamagata Maru.<br>

<p><strong><font size="4">Notice issued</font></strong><br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking up a public 
  interest litigation seeking directions to the Union of India against the denial 
  of freedom fighter status to Kama Gata Maru revolutionists, a Division Bench 
  of the High Court has issued notice of motion for July 23. Copies of newspaper 
  reports published in The Tribune in 1914 were also annexed along with the petition. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his petition, 
  Malwinder Jit Singh Waraich of Saketri had earlier stated that the Kama Gata 
  Maru movement had not been included in the Swatantarta Sainik Samman pension 
  scheme. Going into the background of the case, the petitioner had submitted 
  that Kama Gata Maru - a ship carrying 376 Indian emigrants to Canada - was refused 
  entry to Canada. He had added that the ship remained stranded for two months 
  from May 21, 1914, the revolutionists were provided with just the ration for 
  their return journey. In September 1914, when the ship reached India, the travelers 
  were arrested or fired upon. <br>
