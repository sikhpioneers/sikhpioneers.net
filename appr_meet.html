<H2>Sikhs Address the California Textbook Approval Meeting</H2>(By Prof. Onkar 
S. Bindra)</CENTER><BR><IMG hspace=20 src="images/onkar1.jpg" 
align=left vspase="10"> 
<P>California Sikhs have been unhappy over the fact that the K-8 textbooks for 
History-Social Science in current use have nothing about Sikh ID, culture, or 
history of their immigration. They consider this to be the leading reason for 
ignorance of the masses about the Sikhs.</P>
<P>In July this year, it was found out that even the new books submitted by 
publishers to the California Department of Education (CDE) did not contain 
information on Sikhs. Realizing that the next chance to get Sikh information 
included will be only after six years, the writer attended meetings of the (1) 
Subject Matter Committee on Sept. 29, (2) Curriculum Commission Meeting on Sept. 
30, and (3) Ad-Hoc Committee Meeting on October 31. At each of these, he pointed 
out that the <B>Framework Content Standards</B> require a MULTICULTURAL 
PERSPECTIVE throughout K-8, and REQUIRE material to create AWARENESS about 
different people of the State in Grade one, and information on immigration 
history in Grade four books. He added that the <B>Standards of Evaluation</B> 
required PROPORTIONATE PORTRAYAL. Pointing out that most books did not include 
images of Sikh children and their parents in books for Grade one, or history of 
Sikh immigration in Grade 4, he pleaded that such books not be recommended until 
these are improved by adding Sikh information. Unfortunately, the C.D.E. bound 
by deadlines for replacing old books with new ones, recommended books of 10 out 
of 12 publishers who had submitted new books.</P>
<P>In the light of the above, the Sikh community statewide was requested to 
plead to the State Board of Education (SBE) to postpone approval of books 
proposed by publisher and recommended by the CDE, to give publishers time to 
included Sikh information. A meeting was held at Yuba City on November 6 to 
coordinate the efforts. A dozen concerned Sikhs attended it on the day of the 
Nagar Keertan in which some 60,000 participated. They decided to make a strong 
representation to the SBE at the forthcoming 2005 History-Social Science Primary 
Adoption. </P>
<P>Accordingly, 20 Sikhs, from San Jose to Yuba City in Northern California, 
went to the meeting of the SBE on Nov. 9. </P>
<P>Besides the writer, the following twelve spoke during the Public Comments 
Session: </P>
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Dr. Siri Pritam Kaur Khalsa - President Punjabi American Heritage Society, 
  Yuba City.<BR>
  <LI>Gurpal Singh Khaira - Managing Director, Guru Nanak Mercy Foundation<BR>
  <LI>Dr. Amrik Singh, Teacher Elk Grove School District<BR>
  <LI>Dr. Narinder S. Parhar - President of SIKHS (Sikh Information &amp; Khalsa 
  Heritage Society)<BR>
  <LI>Mr. Sukhdev S. Bainiwal - Bay area citizen<BR>
  <LI>Mr. Paramjit S. Gahra - Lawyer citizen, Bay Area<BR>
  <LI>Dr. J.P. Singh –President, El Sobrante Gurudwara<BR>
  <LI>Mrs. Sarabjit Kaur Cheema - Union City Teacher<BR>
  <LI>Mr. Gurmeet Singh Khalsa - President of Fremont Gurudwara<BR>
  <LI>Dr. Anahat K. Sandhu - Vice-President, World Sikh Council, American 
  Region<BR>
  <LI>Dr. Amarjit S. Bal - Stockton citizen <BR>
  <LI>Mr Inderjit S. Kallirai - Indo-American Cultural Heritage Society</LI></OL>
<P>In a joint statement, on behalf of the entire Sikh community, the writer 
stated as follows: 1. Of the 24.085 million Sikhs worldwide, 583,000 live in 
North America. The 200,000 California Sikhs, who worship in some 50 Gurudwaras, 
end their prayers seeking Welfare of the Entire Humanity. They are significant 
in the socioeconomic fabric of the State. 2 Whereas the <B>Framework Content 
Standards</B> require a MULTICULTURAL PERSPECTIVE throughout K-8, and REQUIRE 
material to create AWARENESS about different people of the State in Grade one, 
and the <B>Standards of Evaluation </B>require PROPORTIONATE PORTRAYAL, most 
books do not include images of Sikh children and their parents in books for 
Grade one. </P>
<P>In the absence of such pictures in the textbooks, students will not know that 
almost all who wear turbans in America are Sikhs, for <B>whom use of tobacco is 
taboo</B>. They will continue to have fear of the unknown, and to have prejudice 
against turbaned Sikhs, even the white skinned American Sikhs. The Sikhs will 
continue to be prime victims of hate crimes that have increased greatly in the 
wake of 9/11. The poster "Common Sikh American Head Coverings" issued by the 
U.S. Department of Justice in 2004 should be reflected in the textbooks.</P>
<OL>
  <LI><B>Sikhs immigration to California </B>started 106 years ago. The Sikh 
  Temple Stockton, dedicated in 1915, has been declared a State Monument. 
  <LI>Pioneer Sikh immigrants worked on railroads and in lumberyards, and many 
  went into farming. They faced discriminatory laws and intolerance from 
  European immigrants. Two Sikh students of Berkeley deserve mention. Dr. Bhagat 
  Singh Thind left studies to serve in the army during World War I, but when he 
  applied for citizenship after his honorable discharge, the Supreme Court 
  denied it. Citizenship of others was rescinded in the wake of this decision. 
  Later, he earned a Ph.D. and became a great spiritual scientist. </LI></OL>
<P>Likewise, Dalip Singh Saund, who earned a Ph.D. from Berkeley, had to go into 
farming because he could not get a job. When elected Judge first time, he was 
not allowed to serve, because he had not completed one year as a citizen. On his 
re-election, he did serve as a Judge. In 1956, he was elected to the U.S. 
Congress. He was the first Asian to serve as Congressman and served three terms. 
In recognition of his services for Civil Rights, an U.S. Post Office in Temecula 
has been dedicated to him.</P>
<P>The writer had earlier submitted to members of the SBE copies of "Sikhs in 
Northern California"; a short DVD produced by the KVIE, the local PBS station. 
The video clip correctly points out that History of Sikh immigration has not yet 
found place in school textbooks. The writer said, "The 4th grade textbooks 
should have history of immigration, and stories of Dr. Bhagat Singh and Dr. 
Dalip Singh Saund, Congressman, in compliance of the Content Standards. </P>
<P>Ending his presentation, the writer said, "Since the textbook approval takes 
place only every six years, and previously approved textbooks are available, we 
urge you to approve the books only after publishers have included pictures of 
Sikh children, parents and grandparents with their head coverings, and other 
relevant information." </P>
<P>information." Dr. Narinder Singh Parhar and Gurpal Singh Khaira mentioned the 
unique features of the Sikh scriptures, Sikh religion and ethics, especially 
standing for religious freedom of even non-Sikhs, citing the martyrdom of Guru 
Tegh Bahadur. Paramjit Singh Gahra said, "ONE OF THE BIGGEST BOONS OF THE SIKH 
TRADITION IS THAT TOBACCO IS TABOO". He asked, "Wouldn't this knowledge about 
Sikhs have a positive effect, as young children do start smoking early in 
schools?” </P>
<P>Dr Anahat Kaur Sandhu, Vice-President of World Sikh Council-American Region, 
emphasized the role Sikhs play in the building of California and recommended 
that teachers utilize the available resource material and presented to the SBE, 
a copy of the book “Religion in Ohio”.</P>
<P>Inderjit Singh Kallirai talked at length about the importance of Sikhs in our 
daily life. He said, "If you travel along Highway 5 from Bellingham in the North 
to San Diego in the South, I can assure you that one of my fellow Sikhs and/or 
Indo-Americans can provide you services, assistance and support along your 
journey: From Gas to a Sandwich, from treating you when sick to providing you a 
warm and safe bed when you are tired; From Fresh Peaches to Raisins, From 
repairing your automobile should it breakdown to that convenient refreshment. 
Not only that, if you use a computer or Laptop, then the Pentium chip was 
designed by an Indo-American, the Hotmail service by another Indo-American Sikh, 
and the World Wide Web's backbone - Fiber optics by another Indo-American 
Sikh."</P>
<P>Sukhdev Singh Bainiwal, Sarabjit Kaur Cheema and Gurmeet Singh Khalsa (All 
from Fremont) related woeful stories of the verbal and physical abuse suffered 
by their kids at school. Krishna Kaur Khalsa, in her written submittal, stated, 
"Being a white American born Sikh doesn’t shelter one from ridicule and 
harassment. My husband has been called Osama Bin Laden and Rag Head by mistaken 
youth of Placerville, where we live." Siri Pritam Kaur Khalsa said, "ONLY 
education can change attitudes towards those that look or dress different. It is 
important that Sikh children be able to see themselves in the books and that all 
American children learn about the contributions Sikhs have made to American 
society." Talking of murder of innocent Mr Balbir Singh Sodhi in a hate crime in 
Arizona and killing of his brother in San Francisco in the wake of 9/11, Dr. 
Amrik Singh of Elk Grove became very emotional. </P>
<P>Dr JP Singh who has conducted Arab Muslim Sikh Cultural Awareness Training of 
Law Enforcement Officials, for the US Department of Justice Community Relations 
Service, to minimize the mistaken identity hate crime killings, reported that 
85% of the Law Enforcement personnel did not know who Sikhs were. He pleaded for 
inclusion of US DOJ Poster type Sikh images in the First Grade Social Studies 
Books. He added." It is my belief that images registered in a child’s mind at 
that age will go a long way in helping them in understanding the communities 
they live in and someday may even deter them from committing mistaken identity 
related hate crimes." </P>
<P>Dr Amarjit Singh Bal &amp; his wife (a retired teacher), in a joint 
statement, stated, "The lack of information about Sikh Americans in the 
textbooks used in the public schools continues to keep the populace ignorant 
about Sikh Americans. The lack of understanding and appreciation among children 
and adults has perpetuated prejudice against the Sikh Americans. The 
pre-existing ethnic prejudice against Sikh Americans further intensified after 
9/11 because of mistaken identity. Sikh children and adults have been victims of 
hate crimes. I view the adoption of 2005 textbooks for California public schools 
as a great opportunity to advance the cause of equal treatment of all people who 
inhabit this Great State.” </P>
<P>Representatives of the SBE, CDE and the Publishers have told this writer that 
the public comments by the Sikhs were very informative and educative, and made a 
deep impression on them. We have made some progress. The speakers are determined 
to continue efforts to get information on Sikhs included in books of all 
publishers with the cooperation of the Publishers and the CDE/SBE. They want to 
be involved in the revision of the History-Social Science Framework for 
California Public Schools from the beginning, in the end of 2006. They want to 
ensure inclusion of History of Medieval India in Grade 7 and of Sikhism, the 5th 
largest world religion, in the elective course “Survey of World Religions”. (The

	<strong><span class="style1">California-School District-Textbooks</span></strong>.</div>
<div>
	The School Districts throughout California are now in the process of 
	deciding on the History-Social Science textbooks for Grades K-8 for adoption 
	and ordering. For each class, textbooks of more than one publisher&nbsp;were 
	recently&nbsp;approved by the State Board of Education.&nbsp;In choosing out of&nbsp; the 
	approved books,&nbsp;the relevant committee of&nbsp;each school district&nbsp;values the 
	opinion of teachers,&nbsp; parents and citizens.&nbsp;It is your&nbsp;privilege to give 
	your opinion to your School District.
	<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">Please exercise it</font>.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	I give, at the end, for your information and guidance, my opinion given 
	recently to a School District that has 50 schools and 52,000 students. You 
	should call your School District&nbsp;and ask them when and where you can see the 
	History-Social Science books they are considering for adoption. Go see the 
	books and give your opinion.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;Look for words &quot;Sikh&quot;, &quot;Punjab&quot;, and &quot;India&quot; in the index&nbsp;at the back to 
	find out if the book includes anything relating to us. <u>Remember that no 
	publisher has done as good a job as <strong>Harcourt</strong> when it comes 
	to K-4 grades.</u> </div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	For Grades 6-8 look for page R-75 on which two publishers have a paragraph 
	on Sikhism and a picture . I&nbsp;prefer the one with Golden Temple than the one 
	with a Sikh. Moreover, the latest edition of the former has a better 
	description than the latter. Oxford's 7th grade history book has a few 
	useful words on its page 95,&nbsp;but we&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot recommend it (<em>An Age of 
	Voyages</em>) until the publisher&nbsp; replaces the blasphemous Mughal (Islamic) 
	Style image of Guru Nanak.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Please do let me know the name of the publisher whose book has been adopted 
	or is being considered for adoption for each grade. Thanks.</div>

<div>
	&nbsp;Here is what I wrote to EGUSD. &quot;&nbsp;I&nbsp;appreciate the &nbsp;State policy of 
	recognizing and emphasizing the diversity in the classroom. I have looked at 
	the displayed books. Regarding inclusion of information on
	<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">Sikhs and India</font>, I found the 
	following:&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Grade 1:</strong> <strong>Harcourt </strong>has 4&nbsp;pictures/names ( 
	pages 85, 236, 238 and 241); McGrawHill has one (page 252), and . Scott 
	Foresman has apparently&nbsp; none.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;<strong>Grade 2:</strong>&nbsp;Of the three publishers, <strong>only Harcourt</strong> 
	has included anything about the Sikhs (page 105). </div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Grade 3:</strong> <strong>Harcourt </strong>&nbsp;has two picture (pages 
	415 &amp; 439).&nbsp; Scott Foresman has a picture and a story of Kalpana Chawla 
	(page 114).&nbsp;McMillan/McGrawhill has nothing.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Grade 4</strong>: Harcourt mentions of Punjabi American Cultural 
	Society of Yuba City (pages 408-409), a pictures of Indian family,&nbsp;and&nbsp; the 
	picture and brief account of the first Sikh and Asia/India/Punjab born 
	Congressman who did much for the Civil Rights of Asian immigrants (pages 
	346, 403). On the other hand, Scott Foresman and McMillan/McGrawhill have 
	apparently nothing. </div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">Considering the above and also the 
	Grade Content, Comprehension Support and Format&nbsp; <strong>I would score 
	Harcourt as &quot;Agree</strong>&quot; and the other two publishers as &quot;Disagree&quot;.</font></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Grade 6: McDougal Littell</strong> is the only one that includes 
	anything on Sikh religion (See R-75). Hence,
	<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">I recommend only McDougal Littell</font>.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Grade 7: Holt&nbsp; et al.</strong> is the only one that has anything 
	on&nbsp;Sikh &nbsp;religion and, hence, I <font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">
	recommend only Holt et al.</font> </div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Grade 8. None of the three publishers has apparently anything on the 
	Sikhs or their religion. So I have <font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">
	no recommendation</font>.</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	I will appreciate hearing the decision of the concerned committee.</div>
