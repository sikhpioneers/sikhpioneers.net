<p><strong>Ghadar Party Officially Wound Up: </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>With the freedom of India from 1947, the Ghadar party in the U.S. became an obsolete organization. From the year 1917 onwards it was there mostly in name with no serious political activities taking place anywhere there. In 1947, one Inder Singh of Fresno was its President. Till then to be a Ghadar member was a great prestige and elections to Gurdwara Committees were held on that. In the 1940s several illegal immigrants among the Hindus were deported and even then Ghadar did not prove as an effective organization to fight on their behalf. In the East, however, there was the India League, and some friendly senators like Senator Langer of New York , who had begun to admire the East Indian scholars and scientists holding key positions in the U. S. industrial plants and Universities. But the problem of East Indians in the U. S. still remained as a problem and in a petition to the Government they said that: </p>
<p>“The independence of India be considered in the light of aims and objects of the Atlantic Charter, and that East Indians who have been residing in the United States for lengthy periods be released from bonds and restraints imposed upon them.” </p>
<p>The Californian Hindus in the meantime decided to gift away the Ghadar party's three story building that was worth 40,000 dollars those days to the Government of India as they thought that was the best thing to do with that. Later, of course, the Indian Consul-General called the Ghadar Board of directors for the meeting of the Indian residents and informed them that the Government of India was pleased to accept the transfer of the party headquarters and to set up a suitable memorial there provided the Indian community contributed 10,000 dollars with the Government of India meeting the rest of the funds. In response to that the five members of the Ghadar Board, all Sikhs, legally transferred the property at a small ceremony. Later an announcement about these developments were made in the Indian Lok Sabha (the House of People) in 1958. They had appropriated 85,000 dollars for the memorial at 5 Wood Street , Berkeley , California , while the estimated cost had gone up to 107,000 dollars for the entire project! </p>

<p><strong>An American View of India &amp; Indians: </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>America , the continent of immigrant races from all over the world, is in a way colourful. There is variety, beauty and dynamism all over, especially in the United States and Canada . The East Indians, including those in Central America , are estimated at nearly two million, and not more. But then they are conspicuous by their light brown features, some with beards and turbans, women with sarees' some saffron robed religious men, and so on. They are conspicuous also in the academic, agricultural and commercial enterprises. However, in a routine opinion poll conducted by the University of Minnesota in 1956, the students and elders had a lot to say about what they knew about India and her people in general. Some of those statements were already stated in prevous chapters' and in continuation, it could be said the following that: </p>
<p>i) India is an undesirable place to live ii) It is a place of sickness and dirt iii) Water in India is polluted; it must be boiled before using iv) Indians criticize too much but cannot take personal criticism v) They have little feeling for human life vi) They are cruel to animals vii) They have little idea of sanitation viii) They are aggressive in groups but have little personal courage </p>
<p>All these points can be reasonably rebutted because things said here need no exclusively be said or ascribed to the people of India alone. America , it must be said, knows very little of the African of the Islamic countries and even about some of the diehard Communist countries. However, some of these points seem to be partly true: </p>
<p>i) India's social structure is undemocratic and inhumane ii) The caste system is the source of most of India's troubles iii) Indian widows lived in misery and abject poverty iv) India talks but does not live up to her moral principles v) Hindu religion created low class society and the supremacy of “rapacious Brahmins” vi) India was never one country until the British came vii) India is too divided to form a nation viii) India's cultural heritage is not productive. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Some more amazing truths or half-truths: </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The above things were said long back when India 's population had not yet reached 500 million, but now after a quarter century there has been immense progress, but problems also have been immense, and the population has now risen to over 700 million. In the assessment of ethics and politics of India , the U. S. intelligentsia, according to the opinion poll, had this to say: </p>
<p>i) India was better off under the British ii) In spite of the democratic system, India is a one-party system with voters largely being illiterate iii) the low level of education will never be raised iv) India is not capable of reaching the cultural or material level of the West v) Indian scientists received recognition because of their Western training vi) To understand each other Indians speak in English vii) Indian women look funny in Western clothes viii) India's development is dependant upon a continuous supply of Western technicians ix) Indians were not ready to assume the responsibilities of independence. </p>
<p>Some more amazing truths (or half-truths) to some of which a reference was already made, are said as below: </p>
<p>i) Indians with a long history of rioting and bloodshed talk about non-violence ii) Gandhi was not motivated by spiritual dedication but a drive for power and self-aggrandizement iii) The freedom movement was carried on only because the middle class Congressmen wanted to take the place of the English iv) The increase in population in India is a threat to the world and to its future security v) The Negros in South Africa are really against the Indians there and not against Europeans vi) Indians fomented the Mau Mau riots in Kenya, and they were widely hated in all African countries vii) Nehru (and his daughter too) are not democrats, he introduced adult franchise only to stick on in power with the votes of the illiterate masses. </p>
<p>All this is a stomach full of home-truths which the East Indians with their pretence to self-respect would find it difficult to swallow- let alone digest all this! But then this is a historical assessment of the past. The elite of North America saw India in the way they said as above in the late 1950s- a quarter century back! </p>

<p><strong>East Indian Visitors to the U. S. : </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The East Indian visitors to North America had always made good in the past. People listened to Swami Vivekananda no doubt but more than that his saffron robes and turban got him high marks in the West ninety years back. Swami Ramatirtha was followed by numerous SADHUs with long beards and strange attires and a good many of them prospered economically because the Americans of those days admitted that they were boorish in understanding those men of the Orient. Rabindranath Tagoe, the Nobel Laureate, had his long flowing robes and his beard. He twice traveled extensively in the West, and his “love” to the United States and Canada would change alternatively according to the circumstances of his long tedious journeys. A detailed account of all this has already been given. </p>
<p>Very significant Bengali academicians and politicians were here and some of them were very active Ghadar agitators. Prof. Kalidas Nag was in New York as a visiting professor in 1930-31. Swami Yogananda of the book- “My Autobiography” and several more renowned men of religion, those celebrated artists Udaya Sankar and Ravi Sankar, were in North America and their tradition ended with the coming of Bhakti Vedanta of the Harekrishna Movement, about all of whom a detailed account will be given in the later volume. </p>
<p>The strange garbs, peculiar accent, the thrill of coming all the way from the Orient and all that had benefited all those visitors to America . Even among the two significant women visitors, Mrs. Sarojini Naidu in 1929 and Mrs. Vijayalaxmi Pandit in 1946, were able to attract audiences in some U.S. town halls mainly because of their costumes. For the Americans of those days, Indian women with sarees, was a spectacle, and in addition to that they were stunned to know fifty years back that women with sarees too could deliver lectures in English. That's the secret of those two ladies making good both in the United States and Europe as political leaders of their country. </p>
<p>Anyway after the second World War, and in the late 1940s, East Indians either with sarees or turbans, were no more a strange spectacle to this part of the word because there were too many of them here. However, in the purely official level, when the prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited North America in 1949 he was the first head of state of India to do so, and he visited the United States for the second time in December 1956. From the side of the United States , President Eisenhower was the first United States head of state to pay a state visit to India in 1959. </p>
