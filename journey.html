<p><i>Comments below appeared in the exhibition <b>A Continuous Journey</b> at the Yuba City Sutter Community Museum in the fall of 1996.  The exhibition commemorated the Punjabi settlement in California.</i>
<p>
<b>A Continuous Journey</b> began almost 100 years ago, when the first Punjabi immigrants came to the Sacramento Valley.  This exhibition, taken from oral accounts, documents and photographs, has been made possible by members of the local Punjabi-American community who have graciously shared information gathered and preserved through the generations.  Due to time and space limitations, we regret that we are unable to tell all of the wonderful stories that make up the rich tapestry of Punjabi heritage in our area.
<p>
<b>Agriculture</b>
<p>
Punjabis made significant contributions in agriculture.  Drawing on centuries of experience as farmers in India, they developed methos of irrigation and cultivation which transformed arid patches of land into fertile soil.

<p><b>Land Tenure</b>
<p>

The enforcement of California's Alien Land Law placed restrictions on land tenure for aliens ineligible for citizenship.  Many Punjabi immigrants bought or leased land under the names of their American-born wives and other family members, or through Anglo farmers, bankers, and attorneys.
<p><b>Field Enrollment Book, Sutter County, 1909</b>
<p>A majority of the early Punjabi immigrants in the Sacramento Valley were of the Sikh faith.  When they came to the United States they usually took the name Singh, which is common to all Sikh males, as their last name.
In later years as the population grew, many of the immigrants returned to using their family or village surnames.

In 1939, Bishan Singh leased land under the name of his American wife, Ernestina Zuniga Singh.

<p><b>Mexican-Punjabi Families</b>
<p>
There were a great number of marriages between Punjabi men and Mexican-American women, several of whom sttled in the Sacramento Valley.  Most couples were married in civil ceremonies, although there were a few Catholic weddings.  While husbands and wives maintained their individual religions, many children were raised in the Catholic faith.  However, Punjabi men often served as godfathers to Mexican-Punjabi children and families of Punjabi men were regular participants in temple activities.
<p>
A  barrier to marriages among Punjabi and Anglo women was posed by California's anti-miscegenation laws, repealed only in 1948.  To avoid such laws, men often took their intended spouses to another county or state.  In one instance, a Sutter County couple was married at sea.
