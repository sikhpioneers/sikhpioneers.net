Congressman Dalip Singh Saund was the first Asian American to be elected to the 
US Congress and to date remains the only Indian American. He was elected in 1956 
from 29th Congressional district comprised of Riverside and Imperial Counties 
of California and reelected twice. While contesting in 1964 for his fourth term 
in the U.S. Congress, he suffered a stroke and became incapacitated. He did not 
win his fourth term. However, he did set a precedent for many Asians to follow 
in the U.S. Congress. He remains a beacon of hope and an example for many Indian 
Americans to succeed him.

      Saund was born on September 20, 1899 in village Chhajalwadi, Amritsar,
Punjab.  He went to a boarding school in Amritsar and Prince of Wales
College in Jammu.  He graduated with B.A. degree in Mathematics from
Punjab University in 1919.  In the US, he enrolled in UC Berkeley in 1920
to study food preservation, in the department of Agriculture.  Later, he
switched to Mathematics and received MA in 1922 and Ph.D. in 1924.
<p></p>
As a student in India, Saund was impressed with Gandhiji.  He became 
his ardent and active follower.  At the same time, he became profound 
admirer of the then American president, Woodrow Wilson whose speeches he 
read over and over again.  His inspiring ideas and ideals to "make the world 
safe for democracy" and provide "self-determination for all peple" appealed 
to him enormously.  It was through Wilson that he became familiar with 
President Abraham Lincoln.  He read Lincoln's life story and studied his 
writings that made an everlasting impression on his young mind.  In the 
preface to his autobiography, <i>Congressman From Indian</i>, he wrote, "My 
guideposts were two of the most beloved men in history, Abraham Lincoln and 
Mahatma Gandhi".  Since Lincoln had influenced him so much, he came to the 
U.S. for further studies in spite of opposition from his family.
<p></p>
     By the time Saund finished his education, he had decided to make
America his home.  He however was aware of the considerable prejudice
against the people of Asia and knew that few opportunities existed for him
or for people of India, at that time.  In spite of being highly educated,
he decided to move to Southern California in the summer of 1925, in search
of a farming job, the only conceivable opportunity.
<p></p>
     Saund started his first job as a foreman of a cotton-picking gang at
a ranch belonging to some Indian friends, a job that hardly required any
schooling much less a college degree.
<p></p>
     From his first job, he saved some money and borrowed more from
friends and ventured into growing of lettuce in partnership.  The entire
crop was a complete, total loss and he was in debt.  Slowly, he cleared his
debt.  During his farming years, he had many ups and downs and went
through the depression era of 1930s.  But he refused to file bankruptcy
proceedings, like some other farmers did, when he suffered losses due to
harvest or market failures.  For him, declaring bankruptcy was a matter of
great shame and against the very principles that he had learnt from his
parents.
<p></p>
Saund, when at Berkeley, had joined Hindustan Association of America, 
which had chapters throughout the U.S. at different universities.  Two years 
later, he became the national president of the association, which gave him 
the many opportunities to make speeches on Indian students.  He was an 
ardent nationalist and never passed up an opportunity even after he moved to 
the Imperial Valley to expound on India's rights to self-government.
<p></p>
     One evening, Saund was invited to speak at the Unitarian Church in 
Hollywood, where he met a yound man, Emil J. Kosa who invited him to visit 
his home as his parents were intersted in India.  During the course of 
conversation with Mrs. Kosa, Emil's mother, Sauda found out that he was a 
co-passenger travelling from Europe to New York, on the same ship with Mrs. 
Kosa and her daugher, Marian.  Saund became a friend of the family and soon 
became a frequent visitor.  He fell in love with Marian, a nineteen-year-
old UCLA student but was not sure if he could marry her.  He was a foreigner 
in a country where the laws prevented him to become a citizen or own a home, 
without a secure job and no clear future.  Still, he did not give up and in 
1928, married Marian Kosa, an immigrant born of Czech parents.  They had 
three children, a son and two daughters.
<p></p>
     Since Dalip S. Saund had become well known as a speaker, the Sikh 
Temple in Stockton asked him to write a rebuttal to Katherine Mayo's book, 
<i>Mother India</i>, which was a sensational book and had become a best seller.  
Gandhiji called it a "drain inspector's report".  In the preface of his 
book, <i>My Mother India</i>, published in 1930, Saund wrote that "it was only 
fitting that The Pacific Coast Khalsa Diwan Society (Sikh Temple in 
Stockton), in its role as the interepreter of Hindu culture and civilization 
to America, should undertake its publication."
<p></p>
     Saund consulted with the board of directors of the Hindustan 
Association of America in 1942, of which he was elected first president.  
The task to get citizenship rights was not an easy one particularly when the 
Supreme Court declared that natives of India were not eligible to U.S. 
citizenship.  In rejection of an appeal of Bhagat Singh Thind (to whom, Saund dedicated his book, <i>My Mother India</i>) about revocation of his U.S. citizenship, the judge held that while persons from India were Caucassians, they were not "white persons", and therefore were "aliens ineligible to citizenship".  Thus thr Legal solution was ruled out as a possibility.  An amendment of the Immigration laws with a special bill to be passed in the Congress of the United States appeared and was alternative worth pursuing.
<p></p>
The Indian farmers could buy or lease land only in the name of their
American friends who sometimes exploited them and even deprived them of
their harvest.  Grant of citizenship rights would nullify the effect of
California Alien Land Law, which prohibited Indians to own or lease land
and property.  Saund had been leasing property in his wife's name as she
was an American citizen.  However, some landowners didn't like leasing
land to an Asiatic's wife for fear of violating the Alien Land Act.  There
were about 2,000 or possibly 2,500 Indians, who could benefit by becoming
citizens of USA.  But they were very skeptical that a major bill aimed at
upsetting a historic decision of the US Supreme Court could be passed by
the Congress.  It was not that they did not want citizenship rights, but
they had suffered so many hardhsips and had been knocked about so much
that it was very dificult for them to believe that there was a chance of
their winning.
<p></p>
	It was a major undertaking to convince the elected represntatives
of American people in Congress on one hand and on the other to mobliize
the Indian community.  Saund, with the help of some dedicated Indians,
made several trips to all parts of California, raised funds, mailed out
thousands of circular letters, mostly in Punjabi, and furnished financial
assistance to Indian groups in New York to lobby at Capitol Hill.  They
were able to convince Congresswoman Clare Booth Luce from Conneticut
and Congressman Emanuel Cellar from New York who jointly introduced a bill
in Congress.  However, selling this concept to the members of Congress was
an uphill task, more so, as its passage could open the door for other
Asians who were similarily deprived citizenship rights.  Indians continued
running into roadblocks in finding a powerful force to push it through.  
Luckily, in 1946, President Truman took special interest in its passage.  
After four years of waiting, the Luce-Cellar bill was finally passed by both
houses of Congress and signed by President Truman on July 3, 1946.  It was
a great triumph, and truly, 3rd of July was the Independence Day for those
Indians in United States.
<p></p>
	  Dalip Singh became a naturalized citizen on December 16, 1949
and was ready to take more active part in the political process of his
adopted homeland.  The primary election was a few months away, in June
1950.  A close friend, Glen Killingsworth was judge in Westmorland, with
whom Saund had worked unofficially for many years in Democratic Party
affairs, encouraged him to run for a seat on the Imperial County
Democratic Central Committee.  Saund's first political victory was without
any opposition.
<p></p>
	A few weeks after the election, Judge Killingsworth suddenly died
due to a heart attack.  It was a great personal loss for Saund, for he had
watched him closely in his work as judge for many years and had admired
the office and the way his friend had filled it.  Saund decided to become
a candidate for that office in the general election in Novemeber,
1950.  He personally knew nearly all the voters in the judicial
district.  So he started a vigorous campaign by ringing doorbells, meeting
people and asking for their support.
<p></p>
    Dalip S. Saund was elected Judge solely due to his exemplary 
grasssroots campaigning.  No other foreigner had by then been elected to any 
high office in Imperial County.  But the judgeship was denied to him as he 
had not been a citizen for one full year by Elecion Day.  Saund's friends 
started circulating a petition addressed to the County Board of Supervisor 
who were to appoint a judge.  More than twice the number of voters than had 
originally voted for Saund, signed the petition.  Most of the mayors of 
cities in Imperial County, the presidents and leaders of different civic and 
professional organizations, including the charimen of both the Democratic 
and Republican county central committes had signed a separate petition.  The 
daily newspaper in the county urged the Supervisors through their editorials 
for appointment of Saund as a judge.  But he lost his first political battle 
through that minor technicality.
<p></p>
     Saund was disappointed buy by no means discouraged.
When he ran for the position of judge in 1952, he ran against an incumbent 
who was appointed by the County Board of businessman and a member of the 
church board.  The campaign also had taken a racial overtone; some people 
would not go for the "Hindu for judge."  But most of the people had felt 
that injustice was done to Saund last time and now was the opportunity to 
correct it.  Saund won the election and served as judge for four years until 
his election to the Congress of the United States in 1958.
<p></p>
     In 1954, Judge Saund was elected chairman of the Imperial County 
Democratic Central Committee and became a member of the Democratic Executive 
Committee of the state of California.  In the same year, Bruce Shangle of 
Riverside County became the Democratic nominee from the 29th Congressional 
district.   He was confident of loyal support from the County Democratic 
party but was not sure of similar support from Riverside county.  Shangle 
assured his full support.
<p></p>
     Judge Saund's Democratic opponent was a well-known Riverside County attorney, 
active in California politics and at one time had been a candidate for attorney 
general of California. He tried to get Judge Saund disqualified on the technical 
grounds that he had not been a citizen for seven years before he could become 
member of the U.S. House of Representatives. First the Appellate Court and then 
the Supreme Court of California dismiss the petition on the grounds that the sole 
judge of the qualifications of a member was the House of Representatives in the 
house itself. 
<p></p>
    Judge Saund had not yet become a familiar name to the voters in 
Riverside County.  But they read his name on the front pages of every 
newspaper in the district, not one time but three times, first when the 
appeal was filed, second time when it was turned down by the lower court and 
third time when the Supreme Court rejected it.  No money could have bought 
him as much publicity and name recognition as these news reports.  But his 
Democratic opponent did not give up.  He, in his newspaper and radio 
advertisements, attacked Saund of his being an Indian and not an American.  
All the tactics used against Judge Saund apparently did not hurt him; he won 
the primary with a tramendous majority.
<p></p>
     In the genral election, Saund faced Jacqueline Odlum, winner of many 
prizes in the field of aviation, leader of women fliers during World War II
and wife of a mutimillion financier.  She was contesting from a distict that 
had always elected a Republican.  She had rich supporters and was personal 
friends of the President of the United States.  At the barbecue rallies, 
people not only would come to see the invited celebraties, such as Bob Hope 
but her also, a celebrity in her own right.  She even had the Vice President 
Nixon come to Riverside to speak for her.



<p>
Judge Saund faced formidable handicaps but was not intimdated.  His
friends and neighbors with the help of Democratic groups in Riverside
County, began to sponsor a series of free barbecues which gave him an
opportunity to meet people and communicate his message.  His whole family,
his wife, three children, his son-in-law and daughter-in-law and score of
volunteers kept busy ringing doorbells and passing out literature.  He did
not have funds to buy space on billboards, so his volunteers made
homemoade billboards on 4x8 foot plywood sheets.  He put up these
billboards throughtout the district and they apparently turned out to be
effective.  His wife and daughter organized and carried out and intensive
campaign of registration of voters and "passed out 11,000 Saund
circulars" before the election.  They had visited thousands of homes with
the help of dedicated volunteers and made a definite impact on many
voters.
<p></p>
Judge Saund had farmed 25 years in Imperial County and was thoroughly
acquainted with the problems of farming communities in both counties.  He
believed that farmerd in the 29th distrist were confident of his
representation of them in the U.S. Congress.  But, it was from the cities,
that he was trying hard to get a fair share of votes.  Thus, in general
election in November 1958, "the first native of Asia" was elected to the
United States of Congress with a 3% vote margin.
<p></p>
There were very few Indian Americans registered to vote in the 29th
congressional district.  In fact there were barely 2500 people of Indian
origin in the entire United States.  He did not have many ethnic voters
either; the large majority being Caucasian Americans.  He did not adopt a
new religion in his new country nor did he Americanize his name to sound
less ethnic.  His opponents repeatedly tried to exploit his being Indian
American.  But he had completely assimilated with mainstream America while
maintaining his heritage.  He actively participated in Democratic Party
activities and rose to be a delegate in three conventions starting in
1952.  He represented grass-roots philosophies and identified with
middle-class values, the values of the people he lived with.  Today,
Indian Americans, seeking political Office invoke Saund's name, much the
same way, as Saund himself invoked Gandhi and President Lincoln's
name.  Like them, he is a source of inspiration and a worthy role model to
look up to.
