<p><strong>In the first decade of this century, as a network of secret revolutionary societies spread from the Panjab and Bengal to Indian communities overseas, an intelligence organization grew apace. This organization depended on a small number of dedicated secret service officers, not the least of whom was William Charles Hopkinson, a man long since remembered in the Indian community in Vancouver.</strong></p>
<p><strong> Hopkinson was born in Delhi in 1880, his father then a sergeant instructor of volunteers at Allahabad, and he grew up in northern India speaking the local languages. In 1903 or 1904, he became an inspector of police in Calcutta and he remained there until sometime in 1907 or early 1908 when he came to Vancouver. In February 1909, he was hired by the Canadian government as an immigration inspector and interpreter. But he never stopped working for the Indian police.</strong></p>
