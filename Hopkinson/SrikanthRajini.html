<p class="style3">Hopkins, the immigration officer involved, was a slightly more complicated individual than Reid. He had been born in India in 1880 and had spent several years of his life there before being posted to Canada, perhaps in 1908. Hopkinson could speak fluent Hindi but was less comfortable with Punjabi, the language of most of the immigrants from India. He served as an informant to the colonial government, keeping its authorities in the know about &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; activities by Indians in North America and sending them regular reports on the movements and speeches of Ghadr Party leasers and other identified &ldquo;troublemakers&rdquo; (for example, Hardayal, Taraknath Das, Guran Ditta Kumar, Balwant Singh, Bhag Singh, and Mewa Singh). </p>
<p class="style3"> Sharon Pollock, an award-winning Canadian playwright, casts Hopkinson as a central character in her play <em>The Komagata Maru Incident</em>. She suggests strongly that Hopkinson&rsquo;s mother was Indian and that Hopkinson was so determined to reject any suggestion of multiracialism in his character that he overcompensated with harsh rhetoric about the inferiority of the brown skinned. </p>
<p class="style3">I know India, and I know its people. When I was a child, my father was stationed in the Punjab &ndash; He had only to shout &ldquo;Quai Hai&rdquo; to summon a slave &ndash; a servant &ndash; no, goddamn it, a slave &ndash; to summon a slave, to scrawl his initials n a chit, and there was a felt carpet from Kashmir, brass ornaments from Moradabad, silver for pocket money, cigars, a horse, a dog, anything he wanted &hellip; My Father was a big man, blond curly hair, wonderful moustache he had, looked like a prince in his uniform. A prince &ndash; surrounded by little beige people (1978, 9).</p>
<p class="style3"> Hopkinson made use of a group of Punjabi immigrants as informants, and through them he learned of the strategies that were being employed by the Shore Committees to gain entry for the passengers. Shortly after the forced departure of the <em>Kimagata Maru</em>, two of these informants &ndash; Harnam Singh and Arjan Singh &ndash; were found brutally murdered. No one was arrested, but everyone appears to have known that they had been killed by someone in the Indian community for having betrayed their people. The third informant, Bela Singh, perhaps fearing for his life, is believed to have opened fire t the temple during a large gathering, killing two people. In October 1914, Hopkinson was called to speak in Bela Singh&rsquo;s defense at his trial. While Hopkinson was waiting to be summoned into the courtroom, another Indian, Mewa Singh, shot him for his support of Bela Singh. </p>
