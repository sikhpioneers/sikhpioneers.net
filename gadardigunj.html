<P><B>Introduction</B> - A note about Gadar di Gunj 
<P> The term &quot;Gadar di Gunj&quot; is given to the unique Complilation of 
  the poetic Compositions which emerged at the initial stage of Ghadr movement 
  and were published and distributed with terrific speed among the Punjabi immigrants 
  in all corners of the world, covering various phases in the political situation 
  in India from the time of battle Palassy. Its patriotic theme inspired in large 
  number with a dream of future democratic Republic based on liberty, equality, 
  and fraternity, free from corruption and without discrimination of any caste, 
  creed, and religion. This poetry was an integral part of Ghadr literature. Its 
  dominant theme was merciless exposure of piratical colonial exploitation of 
  natural resources of subjugated countries in the economic field and oppression 
  and suppression of the people with the force of gun, thus weaving a strong common 
  political bond of struggle against the colonial regimes all over the world. 
  This profoundly patriotic poetry became a matchless source of inspiration for 
  sacrifices at the altar of liberation struggle at national and international 
  level.

      <P>The first poem was written by Pandit Jagat Ram. It was recited by prisoners 
        as a farewell poem for Sarabha. The second poem is also by <A href="famous.html#kartar">Kartar 
        Singh Sarabha</A> and it became popular among the gadarites. These poems 
        can be called the soul of the Gadar Movement, as they depict the depth 
        of their conviction and dedication.
