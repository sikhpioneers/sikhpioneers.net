<P> This photo is taken in Victoria 1904 Topaz and Blackwood Streets in Victoria ,B.C.,Canada...any record of the names in this Photo or would they be found in the records held at the Temple?&nbsp; The reason for this is my want for my brothers and sisters and myself to stop feeling allianated when we consider our Indian heritage We had a white mother and were subject to the ,what we thought were justifiable back then, remarks and enuendos.&nbsp; In the family history it was said that we had a place at prayer ,paid for by our ansestor's, In this "Temple". hmm .This looks to be founding members, what are the chances of a Kudra in this?&nbsp;&nbsp; Biru came here 1900-1920&nbsp; then to Nelson then back to here. I figgure the Temple at this point has lost so much honour by this point that they would never devulge any of that particular information to me.......they would however do this for you........thanks for any help you can give use in advance.   </P>
