Punjabi American Heritage Society (PAHS) of Yuba City is working in partnership with local Sutter County Community Museum to add a new section dedicated to the history of Punjabi American Community in California. This section is going to be the first of its kind in USA. Our purpose is to enhance understanding with other Americans. Punjabi’s were the first group of South Asian people to explore opportunities in this great American land. Our history in California dates back to more than a century. PAHS is looking for old pictures, movies, artifacts, clothing, instruments, old magazines or any thing from past to show case those objects at museum. Any old pictures of individuals, groups, families, functions, events, celebrations, Punjabi Mexican families, Gurdwaras, Temples, Mosques or of any kind are welcome. Originals will returned to owners after making digital copies.
