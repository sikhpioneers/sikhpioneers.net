<b><h2>THE MOVING SPIRIT OF THE <i>GADAR</i></h2></b>


<b>Background</b>

<p align=justify><font face=Times New Roman>This is my third visit to the Gadar Memorial Center. The first one was in Dec 2002,
 the second in July 2004 and this one in May 2006. Such places are like classic books,
 great personalities and historic monuments that evoke different feelings and ideas at 
each trip. The Center building in itself is a simple double storey house with basement 
located in a residential neighborhood of a busy section of San Francisco (SF). 
</p>
 

<p align=justify>The visits are not deliberately spaced out on my part. Every year before visiting my 
son in Northern California, I contact the Indian Consulate office as the Center operations
 are under its jurisdiction. There being no regular hours for its opening a consulate staffer
 specifically comes to open the Center. In fact, a quarter of the Center is used for a make 
shift residential purpose. 
</p>
 

<p align=justify>I don't know of any liaison committee of local Indian Americans and Indian Consulate. With
 active involvement of Indian community some volunteers would gladly help the Consulate in 
keeping the Center open for at least two days a week.  Fortunately, this year, the Consulate
 General B. S. Prakash being himself a writer made sure that some one was there to open it
 when I arrive there. 
</p>
 

<p align=justify>From Davis, CA, the Amtrak train and bus combine brought me in two hours at the Union Square
 in Downtown SF. Since I had an hour before the appointed time, I leisurely walked to the 
Center psyched up. First time, my daughter-in-law drove me there and second time my son. 
Having been raised in the US, they had not idea of the Center. But they are now beginning
 to understand what the Center means to me, and the pivotal role it has played in India's
 real fight for freedom.
</p>
 

<b>Research Material</b>

<p align=justify>During the last two visits, I had only scanned the Center by looking at the titles of the
  books and Gadar publications particularly displayed in two small glass showcases. The 
moment I see them a fountain of energy douses me over. The previous articles captured 
these emotions mixed with the data gleaned. This time I was able to page through two 
pamphlets for extracting eternal messages. In fact, it is equally significant how these
 manuscripts dig the ideas out of my core. These articles are essentially a braid of 
three strands. One is the raw historical data, the present context, and third my incisive 
analysis and bold interpretation.
</p>
 

<p align=justify>1. Anka Di Gwahi (Evidence of the Data) # 4. It is a 16-page Punjabi pamphlet dated 1924, 
and in a very poor condition. 10,000 copies were published. It appears a hand written type
 setting and unclear read. It indicates that the Gadar Party members working in printing 
press came from rural Punjab with little education. Most likely, they wanted nothing to 
do with the Macaulay System of education imposed on India after quelling India's 1857 
Rebellion. The sole objective of pre-independence education was to train Indians for 
servicing the British in India and other colonies. The Gadaris believed it was better 
to remain unlettered than brainwashed.
</p>
<p align=justify>There are startling references as to how the British legislation made life very difficult
 for the Indians. One instance tells of Indians' inability to buy silver (forget gold!) 
for ornamental purposes also used for family emergencies. A concerning data was that 
according to the President of INC (Indian National Congress), the death rate had increased
 from 24/1000 to 34/1000. The taxation on Indians was making their life very unbearable. 
Little money was spent on education as compared with on army and police meant for controlling
 the Indians. Taxation on poor Indians was more than twice than on the prosperous British. 
</p>
 

<p align=justify>During WWI, the British had banned or censored the postal entry of all material going in 
and out of India. Despite these restrictions, a distribution of 10,000 copies to the 
Punjabis in Indian Diaspora was a mark of Gadar network. Indian freedom fighters 
particularly in China, Japan, Canada, Germany, Philippines and Hong Kong etc. 
were in communication with each other mostly at individual bases. 
</p>


 

<p align=justify>2. India against Britain: It is a reply to Austin Chamberlain, Secretary of State 
for Indian Affairs; Lord Harding, Former Viceroy of India; Lord Islington, Under 
Secretary of State for and others. It is a 62-page booklet written in English by 
Ram Chandra, Editor Hindustan Gadar Party; dated November 01, 1916.
</p>
 

<p align=justify>Ram Chandra was also one of three founding members of the Gadar Party 
and became 
the editor of the Gadar (name of the publication too) after Lala Hardayal's forced 
departure from USA. Ram Chandra lived up to his name! He was a lion when it came to 
fighting the propaganda spewed by the British in Canada and USA. This booklet 
contains his letters and articles published in all the leading newspapers in the US.
 His command over the English language was thorough. He challenged the British 
bigwigs for discussion while educating the US public and intelligentsia. 
</p>
 

<p align=justify>It is obvious that while the US Government clandestinely cooperated with the 
British in monitoring the activities and membership of the Gadar Party, yet 
the US press was relatively free. Never once, Ram Chandra complained against 
it. Today, though the internet has crossed all the geographical boundaries 
yet, there are equally advanced technologies to block, censor, and trace or 
decipher any internet message. There is no substitute for human vigilance and 
loyalty; either based on a global ideology like Islamic for Al Quaida or 
regional like political freedom for the LTTE!
</p>
 

<p align=justify>It is also interesting to draw a comparison between the Gadar Party and Gandhi's
 contemporary political activities in South Africa during 1904-15. Gandhi also 
had his own printing press and a publication named Indian Opinion to unite Indians
 and keep them informed. But Gandhi was able to win the hearts of a few British
 thinkers towards his beliefs and approach. 
</p>
 

<p align=justify>For lack public relation and vision of leadership, the Gadar Party did not make
 an impact on the US public. I have seen isolated articles and letters of support,
 but no instance of any white American joining the Gadar Party. In contrast, early 
officers of the INC were mostly British. After permanently returning to India from
 South Africa in 1915, Gandhi fully used the press to his advantage while winning 
the hearts of many British elite and activists.
</p>
 

<p align=justify>It is interesting to discover that the theory, philosophy and practice of Whiteman's
 Burden were not limited to the USA, but extended to Western Europe and their 
colonies. Furthermore, it goes back to the middle of the 19th century! By the 
end of the 19th century, there was a well orchestrated propaganda in the colonies
 that the British were god-sent to improve the lot of blacks in Africa, browns and 
yellows in Asia and aborigines in North and South America, Canada, Australia and 
New Zealand. Theories of Whiteman's Burden also stereotypes the incompetence and 
genetic inferiority of the natives. However, it still goes on; every couple of 
decades only the labels change.
</p>
 

<p align=justify>It is similar to the doctrine of the Divine Rights of Kings as practiced in 
India and medieval Europe. This propaganda was at a pitch during WWI. Under 
Gandhi's leadership, only the INC decided to cooperate with the British with
 a promise of self-rule after the War was over. But the British projected the 
INC stand for the entire India as this booklet brings out the facts. 
</p>
 

<p align=justify>The WWI started in November 1914, but in Sept 1914, 300 Indians were killed 
in Budge Budge, two miles from Calcutta. They were mostly Punjabis who were 
forced to return to India as their ship KOMAGATA MARU was not allowed to dock
 in Canada. At the same time, rebellions had started in Singapore and Ceylon.
 The states of Bengal and NW Frontier were most active in sabotaging the British
 plans. But the Reuter and other news agencies never reported it. India was placed
 under Martial Law on March 18, 1915. 
</p>
 

<p align=justify>Ram Chandra Bhardwaj was a great intellectual. In the very opening of the booklet, 
he blasted the British with his data. He often educated the American public how the
 British in 1770's called the American freedom fighters as "plotters and seditionists".
 His exhortation of the Indians and the denunciation of the majority of  Indian 
princes went on parallel. What shocked me was to read how the proud ruling prince
 of Udaipur touched the feet of King Edward at his Delhi Coronation Darbar in 1911!
</p>
 

<p align=justify>It was Gandhi's rising popularity amongst the emaciated masses of India and 
lack of robust base in the Gadar Party that it did not gain ground in the US.  
However, in India, Subhash Chandra Bose's Indian National Army was only a 
reincarnation of the Gadar Party in India. Once Bose and INA got recognition
 from Germany and Japan, the Gadar Parry naturally merged its identity and 
operation with the INA. Almost all the upper echelon officers in the INA were Punjabis. 
</p>
 

<p align=justify>The rank and file in the INA came largely from Bengal and Punjab who believed
 in the armed overthrow of the British from India. They fought from the East,
 won some battles, marched up to Burma (Myanmar) where they unfortunately lost
 to their brethren Indians and Nepalese Gurkhas fighting for the British! The
 genius of Gandhi was to shift the loyalty of Indians from their British rulers
 to mother India. It came to be known as Gandhi's non-cooperation movement.
</p>
 

<b>Conclusion</b><br>

<p align=justify>About the Center material, it is time to save it for the scholars and interested 
parties by having it digitally scanned. A young Indian documentary producer has 
also shown interest in this project. Once an estimate is taken for turning it 
into CD's, I have assured of raising the necessary funds for it. The time is 
critical for some material as it is almost decayed. Also, it is too much of a
 hassle to go to SF for research work.

<b>Satish Chandra</b><br>

<p align=justify>PS: Gadar is an Urdu word adopted in Punjabi language also, which is equivalent
 to the word ‘revolution' in English. A traitor in Urdu would be transliterated 
in English as Gaddaar, which is also popular in Punjabi and Hindi. An English 
reader must see the big difference in their meanings caused by this subtle
 difference in the Romanized spelling.
</p>
