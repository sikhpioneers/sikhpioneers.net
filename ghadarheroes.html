    Forgotten Story of the Punjab <br>
    Revolutionaries of 1914-15.</p>

  <p align="left">Introduction<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this pamphlet we present to our readers an 
    account of one of the most stirring episodes of our national history - the 
    epic struggle of the lives of men for whom death held no terror - a record 
    of their work, of their suffering and sacrifice extending over a period of 
    thirty years. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the average political worker of today it 
    is a forgotten chapter of our history. Some of them have vaguely heard about 
    the Ghadar Party, about the Komagata Maru, about the numerous hangings and 
    shootings in the Punjab in 1914-15. Nothing more. <br>
    Here for the first time is a connected narrative of these events written on 
    the basis of talks with Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna, the founder of the Ghadar 
    Party and one of its foremost leaders. It tells of simple peasants who became 
    revolutionists and dared to raise the banner of armed revolt at a time when 
    our foremost national leaders could not think beyond &quot;Home Rule.&quot; 
    It tells what those who were hanged did and said. It tells of those who were 
    sentenced to life transportation, how they fought in the Andamans, and what 
    they are doing today. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghadar movement was no ordinary terrorist 
    movement. Its foundations were laid not in India but in America and not by 
    middle-class youths but by Punjabi peasants - mostly Sikhs - who had gone 
    there to earn money and became laborers in farms and factories. With little 
    interest in politics when they left India these men from their own experience 
    became conscious of their status as natives of a slave country. Out of that 
    consciousness was born the Ghadar Party - the party of revolt, the party whose 
    members dreamed of the day when they would return to India and lead armed 
    rebellion against the British rule. They collected money - many of them donated 
    their all - they bought arms, they trained themselves. Their membership reached 
    12,000. <br>
    In the outbreak of the war of 1914 they saw the opportunity to strike. Batches 
    after batches returned to India - nearly 8,000 in two years. Simple peasants 
    as most of them were, they little realized the need for precaution, none of 
    them were clapped in prison immediately on landing, others were interned - 
    the number of these latter alone reached nearly 2,500. But hundreds managed 
    to elude the police, spread themselves in different areas and worked underground. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics in those days meant mainly petitioning 
    to the British Government. The Congress was nothing more than an annual gathering 
    of distinguished Indians who - though many of them were genuine patriots - 
    could not even dream in terms of revolt or any form of direct action. The 
    masses of people had not yet entered the political arena. They seemed inert, 
    apathetic. <br>
    To the returned Ghadarites, it seemed that the only way to overthrow British 
    rule was to bring about a revolt by the Indian Army. They themselves were 
    peasants and the army consisted largely of peasants - many of them their own 
    brother, relatives and friends. Large bodies of Indian soldiers were being 
    sent abroad - to the battlefields of Europe and Asia. They resented it. They 
    hated the idea of going out of their own country and dying at the behest of 
    English officers who daily ill-treated them. And when the Ghadar people contacted 
    them, many of them expressed readiness to revolt. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan failed. Treachery was the immediate 
    cause of the failure, but the real cause lay deeper. A purely military revolt 
    isolated from the people - except as a part of the mass movement - could not, 
    in any case, succeed. Scores were hanged hundreds sentenced to long terms 
    of imprisonment, thousands interned. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those sentenced to transportation for life - 
    among them were old men of sixty as well as youths of twenty - waged countless 
    battles in the Andamans and in Indian prisons against conditions which then 
    were indescribably terrible. Nothing, they vowed would break them. And nothing 
    did break them. Eight of them died in the Andamans fighting to the last. <br>
    They emerged from prison late in the thirties after twenty years and even 
    more - their bodies shattered but not their spirits. <br>
    They did not seek rest and quiet. They wanted to renew the fight. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their own experience - an experience they 
    had gained at the coast of the lives of the finest of their comrades - and 
    events in India as well as abroad, made them realize that the old ways to 
    of work would not do. The entire people had to be roused, a mighty mass movement 
    had to be developed, then only could the army be won over and the final bid 
    for capture of power be made. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the mass movement these veterans plunged 
    and to that movement they bought not only the great traditions of 1914-15 
    but their own ardour, their selflessness, their dauntless courage. They built 
    Congress organizations to the highest committees of which many of them were 
    elected; they built up in co-operation with comrades young enough to be their 
    children and even grandchildren a great kisan movement, they played a leading 
    role in laying the basis for a powerful Communist movement in the Punjab. 
    <br>
    Old in years but young in spirit these men who in 1914 had stood in the forefront 
    of the forces fighting for freedom, now once again demonstrated not merely 
    their steadfastness and courage but also their capacity to learn anew, to 
    imbibe new ideas and take their place in the front ranks of freedom fighters 
    - under the banner of Communism. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all the Ghadar Babas, comrades of the 
    immortal Kartar Singh who even when standing under the shadow of the gallows 
    could not be persuaded to petition for mercy, are today inside the Communist 
    Party. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each name - Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna, Baba Kesar 
    Singh, Baba Rur Singh, Gurmukh Singh, Prithvi Singh and others - is a legend, 
    each has a story that would fill pages. The love and respect that these names 
    evoke in the rural areas of the Punjab has to be seen to be believed. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great events have happened since 1914, when 
    these men came to India. Our people have since then built up a powerful national 
    movement. The flame of revolt that these heroes sought to kindle has today 
    spread to every corner of the country. The basis has been created to make 
    the final bid for the capture of power. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this critical stage of our history the life-story 
    of these Ghadar veterans who staked their all for winning freedom, who suffered 
    and sacrificed as few have done, should inspire our countrymen and lead them 
    forward. <br>
    December, 1945. Ajoy Ghosh.</p>
  <p align="left">For A Livelihood<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last decade of the 19th and in the 
    opening years of the 20th century, thousands of Punjabi Sikh kisans, young 
    and old, left their country and went abroad to earn their living. They had 
    found it increasingly difficult to eke out even a scanty living on their own 
    little patches of land. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period was one of ever-deepening economic 
    crisis. The 150-year-old process of imperialist exploitation was having its 
    full effects. The entire Indian economy lay shattered with little sign of 
    regeneration. Urban handicrafts had disappeared and village artisans were 
    facing ruin. Pressure on land was increasing; sub-division and fragmentation 
    of land and expropriation of the peasant went on at a rapid pace; agriculture 
    deteriorated. Simultaneously the burden of debt, rent and land revenue was 
    mounting. Famines completed the disaster. Agriculture had become a mere gamble. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sheer desperation and in the hope of earning 
    a livelihood elsewhere the peasants of the Central Punjab districts, sturdy 
    and adventurous, began to migrate abroad. Thousands mortgaged their land, 
    sold their cattle and implements, raised a little cash on loan and bade farewell 
    to their native land. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exodus quickened as the 20th century advanced. 
    They went to Burma and Malaya, to Singapore and thence to Hong Kong, Shanghai 
    and to other parts of China and even to Australia. Strong of build, they got 
    jobs in the Police or served as watchmen. Others became traders and contractors. 
    They were making more money than at home, and felt satisfied. The natives 
    of these lands, however, regarded them as mere cogs in the machine of foreign 
    oppression and exploitation and therefore hated them. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They got news of still higher wages and better 
    prospects in America. The fortunate ones, who had got there wrote back home 
    and to their friends and relatives abroad. The stream of Indian emigrants 
    turned still further east, towards this new land of opportunity. On the eve 
    of the First World War, there were over 15 thousand Indians, mostly Punjabi 
    Sikhs, in America and in Canada. </p>
  <p align="left">The Curse of Slavery<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America the factory owners and farmers paid 
    them well. They were earning two to three dollars (six to nine rupees) day 
    each. Still with their great capacity for work and lower standard of living 
    they were cheap as compared to American labor. Competition and conflict were 
    inevitable. But the period was one of &quot;prosperity&quot; and it passed 
    without much trouble. <br>
    Then came the economic crisis of 1907 accompanied by wide spread unemployment 
    and wage-cuts. The American workers organized in their trade unions fought 
    back the capitalist on-slaught, but not so the Indian laborers. Unorganized 
    and actuated by the single motive of making money, they were often and easily 
    utilized by the factory owners as blacklegs. Their strike breaking, as during 
    the railway strike at Tacoma (Oregon), work the Indians the contempt and hostility 
    of American workers. Widespread anti-Indian sentiment grew and took root. 
    Gangsterism, the typical outcome of American labor conditions followed in 
    its wake. Indian lodgings in the towns of William Ebert, St. John, Tacoma 
    and elsewhere were attacked and looted, the laborers themselves forcibly pushed 
    into cars and lorries and left stranded far away outside the town. The police 
    was forewarned, knew what was happening and connived at it. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic crisis passed and with it the organized 
    gangsterism. But anti-Indian agitation continued. The American outburst of 
    the past few years had been directed as much against other European and Asiatic 
    emigrants as against the Indians. But these others were free people and their 
    Government saw that for every single dollar of damage done to its citizens 
    ten dollars were paid; but the British Consuls and the British Ambassador 
    refused to intervene on behalf of the Indians. For the first time it dawned 
    upon the Indian immigrants that they were slaves. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indians in America were mainly concentrated 
    in California, Oregon and Washington. Men like &quot;Potato King&quot; Jwala 
    Singh, his partners Wasakha Singh and Santokh Singh, Sohan Singh Bhakna, Kesar 
    Singh, Kanshi Ram - these and many others were making good money. But now, 
    on looking round, they found that money could not buy respect for them. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere they were insulted and despised. 
    In hotels and trains, parks and theatres, they were discriminated against. 
    Everywhere hung notice-boards: &quot;Hindus* and Dogs Not Allowed.&quot; A 
    white man refused to sit at the same table with Sohan Singh Bhakna; another 
    said to Kesar Singh, &quot;You deserve not a job but a bullet&quot;; still 
    others would ask them about their population, sharply adding with a sting, 
    &quot;Three hundred millions! Men or Sheep?&quot;<br>
    So it went on. There were, no doubt, American friends both inside and outside 
    the Labor movement with greater sense of justice and politeness. But all they 
    could do was to offer the consoling explanation, &quot;Americans hate slavery 
    - and you are slaves.&quot; What had passed unnoticed all these years became 
    the most glaring fact of their life, indelibly imprinted upon every Indian 
    mind - yes, they were slaves. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position was no different in Canada. The 
    Canadian authorities at first advertised the unhealthy Honduras as &quot;the 
    best land on the face of earth&quot; and wanted the Indians in Canada to migrate 
    there. A deputation led by Bhagwan Singh, Balwant Singh and Sant Teja Singh 
    found this &quot;heaven&quot; a veritable hell and let out the truth. The 
    Indians refused to settle down in Honduras at &quot;Government expense&quot; 
    or otherwise. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now came the notorious Immigration Law of 1910. 
    No Asiatic could enter Canada unless he carried two hundred dollars with him 
    and had undertaken a continuous journey with a &quot;through&quot; ticket 
    from his native country to Canada. Evidently this was intended to hit the 
    Indians, a slave people without any shipping services of their own. </p>
  <p align="left">Birth of a New Idea<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning shame of having been born in a slave 
    country made the Indians appreciate all the more strongly the worth of American 
    democracy. In that democracy with its political equality its respect for the 
    rights of the common citizen and its atmosphere of freedom they began to see 
    the highest achievement of man in the field of government. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the flame was kindled. Out of their sense 
    of national humiliation and their newly acquired ideals of democracy came 
    a new awakening. They looked round and saw new national movements arising 
    in Ireland, China, Egypt and Turkey. Revolutionary intellectuals like Hardyal 
    and Barkatullah, till now working in isolated groups and anarchistically inclined, 
    came into healthy contact with the mass of Punjabi laborers. Soon the Gurdwaras 
    at Stockton in California and Vancouver in Canada became centers of intense 
    political activity. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fields of California, in the factories 
    of Oregon and Washington, in centers separated by thousands of miles, a new 
    idea was being born - the idea of revolt against British rule. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time was ripe for consolidating the awakening 
    into an organization and a movement. </p>
  <p align="left">The Ghadar Party<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sohan Singh Bhakna who was at that time working 
    in a timber factory at Astoria took the initiative. A meeting was held there 
    on 13th March 1913 to which came 120 Indians including forty representatives 
    from towns and factories of Oregon and Washington. Another, a bigger and more 
    representative gathering, was held on 1st November 1913 at San Francisco to 
    confirm the decision of the last meeting. 15,000 dollars were collected at 
    these two meetings and the Hindi Association of America was founded. It was 
    decided to bring out a weekly paper, &quot;Ghadar&quot;, named in commemoration 
    of the Mutiny of 1857, in Urdu, Hindi, Marathi and Gurmukhi. This gave the 
    Association its now hallowed name - the Ghadar Party. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prominent among the founders were Sohan Singh 
    Bhakna, Jwala Singh, Wasakha Singh, Santokh Singh, Kartar Singh Sarabha, Kesar 
    Singh, Prithvi Singh, Rur Singh, Nidhan Singh Mahesri, Nidhan Singh Chuga, 
    Kanshi Ram, Jagat Ram, Karam Singh Cheema, Bhag Singh Canadian, Sher Singh, 
    Lal Singh, Udham Singh Kasel, Santa Singh Gandiwind and Harnam Singh Tundilat 
    - names that recall the epic of life-long battles and superhuman sacrifice 
    in the cause of country's freedom. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resolutions founding the Ghadar Party laid 
    down its aim as the overthrow of imperialist Raj in India and the building 
    up in its place of a national republic based on freedom and equality. This 
    aim could be achieved only by an armed national revolution. Every member of 
    the Ghadar Party was declared to be honor and duty bound to participate in 
    the fight against slavery carried on anywhere in the world. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first elections Sohan Singh Bhakna and 
    Hardyal were elected as President and Secretary respectively. Jwala Singh 
    and Kesar Singh were elected Vice-President, Kanshi Ram, Treasurer, Karim 
    Bux and Munshi Ram, Organizing Secretaries. An Organizing Commission of Three 
    for more secret and political work was also elected. Kartar Singh Sarabha, 
    Harnam Singh and Jagat Ram were to assist Hardyal in bringing out the Ghadar. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Office of the Party which came to 
    be known as Jugantar Ashram remained at 436 Hill Street, San Francisco, till 
    1918 when the Party built its own building at 5 Wood Street. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st November 1913 the first issue of the 
    Ghadar came out carrying its flaming message of anti-imperialist national 
    revolt. Every issue gave them &quot;a rough account of the British Raj&quot; 
    - a narration of the untold suffering and utter degradation it had brought 
    on the Indian people. To the fighters in the cause of freedom it promised 
    only death and martyrdom - yet members began to pour in. The membership of 
    the Ghadar Party soon swelled to five thousand. Subscriptions and donations 
    began to flow in. Every penny of this sum raised by the sweat and toil of 
    thousands of Indian laborers was precious and the leaders knew it. They had 
    themselves given their all and were working as whole-timers on sustenance 
    wages. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghadar and with it the organization began 
    to spread to Canada, Malaya, Japan, China, the Philippines, Fiji and the Argentine 
    - and even reached out to India. In a few months America and Canada alone 
    had over 72 branches of the Party. <br>
    The young Ghadarites soon established contacts with brother fighters of other 
    lands, Czarist Russia, China and Ireland. And how proud they felt when one 
    of them seeing 25 Indian revolutionaries living in Jugantar Ashram at the 
    bare cost of 2 dollars a day said, &quot;If India's sons can live, work and 
    fight like this, the day of her freedom is not far off.&quot;<br>
    The Ghadar Party was more than a conspiracy; it was a whole movement. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the British Government knew it. They tried 
    to break it. They sent spies into the Ghadar Party, they imported them as 
    Granthis (priests) in the Gurdwaras to denounce the leaders. They joined hands 
    with the worst elements in America and even inspired and supported the anti-Indian 
    agitation. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1914 Hardyal was arrested as an &quot;undesirable 
    alien&quot; for deportation. The Party bailed him out and sent him to Switzerland. 
    The bail money was of course forfeited. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardyal failed to establish contact with the 
    Ghadar Party after this and his role in the movement ended. But the storm 
    continued to sweep on in America. The Party strengthened every day. In the 
    meantime war-clouds were gathering over Europe. </p>
  <p align="left">The Komagata Maru<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Immigration law of 1910 affected 
    not only future immigration, it also meant that Indians in Burma, Malaya, 
    Singapore and China would remain stranded, unable to proceed further. And 
    these were the men who had sold or mortgaged their all to get abroad. The 
    wives, mothers and sisters of Indian settlers in Canada now reached the Canadian 
    coast only to spend a few months in the Quarantines and then turn back. A 
    storm of protest and indignation arose against it among the Indians everywhere 
    but the Secretary of State for India refused even to meet a deputation about 
    it. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Government evidently believed that 
    they had said the last word on the matter. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they had counted without the resourcefulness 
    of men desperately anxious to earn a livelihood for themselves and now eager 
    to answer back the arrogant challenge. Money was raised in America and Canada. 
    A Japanese ship, the Komagata Maru was chartered at Hong Kong by Baba Gurdit 
    Singh. It took about 400 passengers aboard at Calcutta and Singapore and on 
    14th April 1914 it sailed for Canada. The ship reached Vancouver on the 23rd 
    of May. Every provision of the new law had been fulfilled but even now the 
    Canadian Government refused to allow the passengers to land and ordered the 
    ship to be taken back to India. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passengers refused to obey the orders - 
    the struggle began. Days passed, all provisions were exhausted and even water 
    began to run short. Not satisfied with this and finding the passengers adamant, 
    the Canadian Government threatened to use force. Canadian men of war surrounded 
    the Komagata Maru and news went out that fire would be opened if they did 
    not move away. <br>
    Already the Indian community in Canada and America had risen to a man to defend 
    the rights of the passengers. 22,000 dollars, still due for the hire of the 
    ship, had been collected and paid. Meetings and demonstrations had been organized 
    everywhere - even Canadians had been moved and had protested against the use 
    of force. Indignation was already reaching the boiling point when news of 
    this new threat - the threat that fire would be opened if the Komagata Maru 
    did not move out - reached the Indians. At the Vancouver Gurdwara a meeting 
    of 4,000 Indians was held. The atmosphere was electric. It was resolved to 
    reply to force by force and set the whole city aflame if fire was opened on 
    the Komagata Maru. This had a restraining influence on the Canadian Government. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the plight of the passengers worsened. Without 
    food, without sufficient water, it was impossible for them to continue the 
    fight much longer. On the 23rd of July the Komagata Maru was compelled to 
    leave the harbor - the Canadian Government only agreed to pay all expenses 
    incurred by the passengers. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The returning Komagata Maru was, by now, a ship 
    of revolution. Its passengers had already staked their all in the attempt 
    to get abroad. They were now inspired with the single determination to end 
    British Imperialism and work for their country' honor and freedom. Among these 
    passengers was young Gurmukh Singh. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghadar Party had done all it could to aid 
    the passengers of the Komagata Maru but this inhuman and insulting treatment 
    of their fellow countrymen put an end to their hearts for years now burst 
    forth. A Government which made the Komagata Maru incident possible had no 
    moral right to exist. </p>
  <p align="left">Back To Their Homes<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghadar Party had not merely organized the 
    Indians abroad; it had done much more. In a surprisingly short time the idea 
    of freedom had completely transformed the life of these emigrants. Narrow, 
    selfish competition had given place to unity in one brotherhood fighting for 
    the same ideal. Days of black legging and strikebreaking were over; they were 
    now joining the trade unions. The drinking brawls, in which they had figured 
    so prominently in the past, had ended. These were now considered a national 
    disgrace. They had at last begun to think of something bigger than a few dollars, 
    and the Americans respected them for this. Three of them (Americans) including 
    a woman even came to fight with them. The British Government, however, arrested 
    them and sent them back. Even the factory owners screwed up their eyes and 
    asked, &quot;What has happened to these Indians?&quot;<br>
    Early in 1913 a delegation of three Ghadar Party members had come to India 
    to carry on anti-imperialist propaganda among the people. The Ghadar Party 
    members knew that the fight agai8nst British rule had to be waged in India 
    itself and they looked upon their activities in America as merely a prelude 
    to that fight. The Komagata Maru affair deepened their hatred against British 
    rule. The shadows of the coming war sharpened their sense of emergency. Meetings 
    were held all over America in which thousands came forward as volunteers for 
    the coming battles. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna had left America with 
    the Komagata Maru passengers. Another batch in which were Kartar Singh Sarabha, 
    Prithvi Singh, Karam Singh Cheema, Kesar Singh, Jwala Singh, Rur Singh, Jagat 
    Ram and many others, left immediately after the outbreak of the war. Now was 
    the time to strike! The Party ordered all its members to return to India. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exodus homeward began, thousands left behind 
    them their lucrative jobs and business worth lacs of dollars, built through 
    years of hard and strenuous labor. Many of them carried arms, now their most 
    precious possession. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They knew little about the situation in India. 
    One single idea had taken possession of their minds: an opportunity like the 
    present one would never come again. They might all die but they would die 
    after they had struck a blow for freedom. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Japan Barkatullah, in Shanghai Mathra Singh, 
    and in Hong Kong Bhagwan Singh had built up the Ghadar Party. Everywhere on 
    their way back among the settlers of China and Japan and Soldiers of Hong 
    Kong and Singapore, the returning emigrants preached the gospel of armed national 
    revolt and won new recruits. Among these were Gujjar Singh and Sucha Singh. 
    <br>
    They passed the mist-surrounded Andamans, that standing monuments of imperialist 
    terror. They vaguely imagined heroes lying handcuffed and fettered in its 
    dark tomb-like cells. With tears in their eyes but grim determination in their 
    hearts, they pledged anew, &quot;We return, Motherland, to smash your chains 
    for ever!&quot; In their unbounded enthusiasm very few realized that in another 
    year's time many of them would be sharing these very dungeons. <br>
    <br>
    Welcome With Bullets<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government of India was fully informed of 
    this revolutionary homecoming. Their spies like Ram Chander had reached high 
    places inside the Ghadar Party. The Party, moreover, had made no secret of 
    its agitation and aims. Nor in their burning enthusiasm, coupled with lack 
    of experience, had they tried to keep secret the decision to return to India. 
    Spies shadowed them specially from Hong Kong onwards. At Calcutta the Government 
    was ready to receive them &quot;free of charge&quot; into special trains under 
    armed military and police guards. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Komagata Maru was the first to reach Hooghly 
    on the 27th September and was moored at Budge Budge at 11 a.m. on the 29th. 
    Its passengers had not been allowed to land at Hong Kong and Singapore. Needless 
    to say, they refused to board the special trains now. A clash occurred and 
    the police opened fire 18 were shot dead and 31 arrested and put into prison. 
    Only 60 could be got off into the train, about 30 including Gurdit Singh, 
    escaped. The martyrs of Budge Budge are to this day remembered in the patriotic 
    songs of the Punjab. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other emigrants were in Shanghai, Hong Kong, 
    Penang and Rangoon when they got the news of this reception with bullets. 
    It added fuel to the fire. They grew still more indignant; but they also realized 
    the need for caution. Chinese revolutionaries whom they met also advised caution. 
    Most of the arms that they were carrying with them - arms they loved more 
    than any other of their possessions - were thrown overboard. Some tried to 
    enter India through Burma, others broke up into smaller groups and tried to 
    trickle in. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these precautions came too late and not 
    all adopted them. Sohan Singh Bhakna, among the first to arrive in a batch 
    of one hundred, was arrested immediately on landing. The Tosa Maru passengers 
    numbering 173, among whom were most of the leaders of the Party, were all 
    arrested on reaching India; later 73 were released and the rest one hundred 
    were kept in Montgomery and Multan Central Jails. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 3,125 emigrants that passed through the 
    hands of the police during this period about a thousand were sent to prison 
    or interned. Later more arrived. Altogether, during the first two years of 
    the war, about 8,000 persons returned - the Ghadar Party membership at the 
    time was over 12,000 - of whom 400 were jailed and 2,500 interned. <br>
    For dealing with these men the Government of India had already armed itself 
    with special powers and these powers were ruthlessly used. Most of the plans 
    which the returning revolutionaries had made while on board their ships - 
    plans distribution areas of activity, filling up leaders etc. - were nipped 
    in the bud. </p>
  <p align="left">Planning Armed Revolt<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having taken these precautions the Government 
    felt they had finished with the Ghadar Party. But they were mistaken. <br>
    More than 6,000 had already returned and the police had failed to keep track 
    of at least half of them. No doubt many of these settled down peacefully in 
    their homes but the rest carried the message of freedom and revolt to their 
    people. Kartar Singh Sarabha, Pingley, Kanshi Ram, Jagat Singh and many others, 
    the police were unable to lay their hands upon. Pandit Jagat Ram escaped right 
    before their eyes at Calcutta and Prithvi Singh quietly walked out of the 
    prison-train at Rawalpindi. Others like Gurmukh Singh defied the internment 
    orders and joined in. Men like Karam Sing Cheema worked while in internment. 
    The original plan had been disorganized, their ranks temporarily broken, but 
    these men, never daunted, soon established contracts and got down to work. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appeared to them that the only way to overthrow 
    British rule was to infect the Indian Army with the idea of revolt. And why 
    should they not succeed? After all, the army consisted largely of simple peasants 
    like themselves. Their fathers, brothers and relatives were there in it. All 
    that was necessary was to open their eyes to the disgrace of slavery. Already 
    the army was seething with discontent. Soldiers hated the idea of going abroad, 
    to Mesopotamia, to France, to strange lands to die at the bidding of the British 
    Government. Let the banner of revolt be raised by a band of determined revolutionaries, 
    they argued, and thousands would flock under it. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contacts were soon established with older revolutionary 
    groups in Bengal and the U.P. through Sachindra Nath Sanya V.G. Pingley and 
    Rash Behari Bose. These groups had much greater experience in conspiratorial 
    work, but they had gone little beyond college students and middle-class youth. 
    The Ghadar revolutionaries were the first to take revolutionary ideas to the 
    Army and the peasantry. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They soon found their feet. Guerilla bands of 
    4 to 5 members were organized. Their literature was becoming increasingly 
    popular. Out of the way small Gurdwaras became the centers of revolutionary 
    activities. In many villages kisans openly defied the police to give shelter 
    to their revolutionary sons. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important of all was the work in the Army. 
    19-year-old Kartar Singh Sarabha, a former student of the Revenshaw College, 
    Orissa, stood out as the model revolutionary organizer. Always on his bike, 
    he would travel hundreds of miles at a stretch leaving in his wake the burning 
    trail of revolt. There was not a single cantonment from Bannu down to Benares 
    that he had not visited and created revolutionary centers in. Brilliant and 
    resourceful, with unfailing presence of mind he would go dressed as an officer 
    and take the salute from unsuspecting guards. &quot;if you must die, why not 
    die under the revolutionary flag, in your own country's cause?&quot; - he 
    would tell the discontented Indian soldiers, daily dreading to be sent abroad. 
    The Indian garrisons at Ferozepur, Rawalpindi and Lahore promised to revolt. 
    The spark was lighted among the soldiers at Meerut, Lucknow, Fyzabad, Cawnpore, 
    Allahabad and the flames reached out as far as Jubbulpore and Dacca. Even 
    in the distant Burma and Malaya Ghadar revolt was maturing with No. 16 Dufferin 
    Street, Rangoon as its headquarters. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment seemed opportune. Besides smouldering 
    discontent in the Army, there was growing agrarian unrest among the Muslim 
    peasants of south-west Punjab. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21st February 1915 was fixed as the date of 
    the uprising. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already in December things were getting hot 
    for the Government; military and police posts were attacked, Government treasuries, 
    mail bags and railway stations looted in several parts of the province to 
    get cash for the revolutionary cause. Arrests were made but the Government 
    was growing panicky. On the 19th December they went begging to the Central 
    Government for a special ordinance to meet the situation. &quot;It is most 
    undesirable at the present time to allow trails of any of these revolutionaries&#133; 
    to be protracted by the ingenuity of counsel and drawn-out to inordinate length 
    by the committal and appeal procedure which the criminal law provides,&quot; 
    they wrote in their letter. The claim &quot;that bulk of the people are well-disposed&quot; 
    sounded pitiably hollow beside this. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;February 21 was approaching fast and the preparations 
    grew more intense. With Lahore as the centre the net was thrown far and wide. 
    A press was established at Amritsar and bomb factories at Lohatbaddi and Jhabewal. 
    Arms were being collected, Jagat Ram was sent to Kabul and Parmanand of Jhansi 
    to Bengal. A new four-colored national flag was decided upon, the revolutionary 
    uniforms and emblems were got ready and the declaration of war against the 
    British Government drawn up. <br>
    The situation seemed to be developed favorably. The major part of the British 
    Army was on the battlefields of France, the number of disgruntled Indians 
    in the country was overwhelming. War was having its effect, prices were rocketing 
    up causing widespread discontent. All kinds of rumors were afloat. A hermit, 
    Sri Maha Prabhu Jagbandhu, from distant Himalayas who had promised freedom 
    to India at the end of his 13years Tapasya was said to be coming out of his 
    cave any day. In the streets of Calcutta people whispered about some impending 
    catastrophe in the Punjab. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revolutionaries had planned with precision 
    and accuracy; their facts, figures and information were unimpeachable. One 
    fateful night the attack would be launched, towns and cantonments suddenly 
    stormed and arsenals and magazines captured with the aid of the soldiers. 
    After releasing the prisoners and taking over treasuries, all the revolutionary 
    bands and soldiers were to assemble in the Punjab, they would now be strong 
    enough to give battle to the enemy for another year. And who could say the 
    whole country would not rise to a man once the flag on revolution triumphed 
    in one province?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uprising was to begin in the cantonments 
    of the Punjab and spread eastward. It was the most powerful revolt planned 
    since the Mutiny of 1857. </p>
  <p align="left">The Blow Falls<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now when the entire plan was ready and expectant 
    eyes were focused on the Punjab - the fatal blow fell. <br>
    During the night of 18th February and early next morning people in the major 
    cities of the province saw truck-loads of white soldiers pouring in. Together 
    with the police they posted themselves at the key points and started patrolling 
    the streets. In the cantonments too the British soldiers had taken over the 
    arsenals, the watch was increased and military discipline enforced more rigorously. 
    The onlookers watched these grim preparations and wondered if these were some 
    emergency war measures. <br>
    The Government had struck. A spy, Kirpal Singh who had sneaked into the Ghadar 
    Party had informed the police of the projected uprising. The revolutionaries 
    made a last-minute effort to bring it off on the 19th February. But the opportunity 
    was irretrievably lost - the secret was out again. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When early on the 19th morning young Sarabha 
    with his band of 50 revolutionaries reached Ferozepur, not all his eloquence 
    could rouse the soldiers out of the torpor of disappointment and despair into 
    which they had sunk. They merely pointed at the white soldiers stiffly parading 
    the distance - others only wept. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All seemed lost. The dreams cherished for years 
    had come to nothing, the hard work of months had turned to dust. For a moment 
    tears stood in the eyes of even Kartar, the fearless warrior who had never 
    known defeat and frustration. <br>
    Now the real manhunt began. For the next two weeks terror held to Punjab in 
    its grip. Everyone was suspect and very few escaped. Over 200 arrests were 
    made. Kartar Singh Sarabha refused when asked to go abroad. &quot;With all 
    my comrades inside the jail how can I even think of doing such a thing,&quot; 
    he calmly answered. He was arrested among the soldiers at Wazirabad. <br>
    Pingley was arrested in the lines of the 12th Cavalry at Meerut &quot;with 
    a collection of bombs, sufficient in expert opinion to blow up a regiment,&quot; 
    as Michael O'Dwyer said. <br>
    Jagat Ram was arrested at Peshwar. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order had been restored, though the Government, 
    but clashes and conflicts with those who had escaped arrest continued till 
    September 1915. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Waging War Against The King Emperor&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrested men were to be tried, but not before 
    the Government had made things secure for itself. <br>
    A Defense of India Act was hurriedly rushed through the Imperial Legislative 
    Council, its most important provisions were the appointment of Special Tribunals 
    for trying revolutionary cases. It allowed neither commitment proceedings 
    to these Tribunals nor judicial appeals from their decision. One such Tribunal 
    of three was set up in the Punjab. Its only Indian member was one Shiv Narain 
    Sharma. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 27th March 1915 the first Lahore Conspiracy 
    Trial opened in Lahore. <br>
    Barrack No. 16 in Lahore Central Jail had been specially improvised to serve 
    as the hall for the trial. On a slightly raised platform sat the Special Tribunal, 
    the symbol of imperialist justice. The Public Prosecutor Pitman with his colleagues 
    and a host of C.I.D. officials took his seat on the right. On the left stood 
    hand-cuffed, 65 men charged &quot;with conspiracy to wage war against the 
    King Emperor.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the accused were those who had been arrested 
    before they set foot on Indian soil. Those, like Sohan Singh Bhakna, who were 
    arrested at Calcutta itself were threatened and bribed but they refused to 
    betray their comrades. Others had been arrested while carrying on the struggle 
    and some of them had not been to their homes since their return from America. 
    Old men of 60, Bhan Singh, Nidhan Singh and Kehar Singh stood in the dock 
    together with young lads, Sarabha, Prithvi Singh and Gurmukh Singh, barely 
    in their twenties. They hailed from all over the province. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused felt from the very beginning that 
    the whole trail was a stage farce. Nor did they ever want to defend themselves: 
    &quot;Why ask for justice from those you seek to overthrow?&quot; They contemptuously 
    rejected the very idea. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, however, wanting to give the 
    appearance of justice, had engaged nine lawyers for the Defense. The very 
    first encounters in the case showed that except for one they were perhaps 
    all appearing before a court for the first time. Most of the accused did not 
    know English and could not follow the proceedings. The few who knew the language 
    did not care to. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the same the trail continued and the Prosecution 
    were the masters throughout. To the witnesses they pointed the accused. They 
    wanted them to be recognized and Jwala Singh was given 30 lashes for objecting 
    to this. He was considered guilty by the Jail Superintendent of insulting 
    an official and interfering with the due carrying out of law. Witnesses would 
    say, &quot;I have to do as 'Sarkar' birds me to do&quot; - as Numbardar Ala 
    Singh of Bhakna did pointing his finger at a Sub-Inspector of Police sitting 
    with the Prosecution. Yet everything was deemed in order. One Defense lawyer, 
    Raghunath Sahari, started when Kesar Singh casually pointed out that having 
    been arrested on the ship he could not be charged with any prejudicial acts. 
    &quot;What are you dreaming of?&quot; he faltered, his eyes wide open with 
    amazement, &quot;Better get ready to face the gallows.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knew where the trail was leading.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the months passed by. The accused laughed 
    and joked and exchanged reminiscences as 404 Prosecution witnesses and 228 
    Defense witnesses were gone through. The President would ring the bell, wait 
    a few minutes and shout, &quot;Proceed.&quot; And he had to repeat the performance 
    quite often - the accused were such an inattentive lot!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial was nearing its end. The 65 held counsel. 
    It was decided that seven who had led the struggle after their comrades were 
    arrested at Calcutta should accept full responsibility for all that had happened 
    and enter their statements. There was a keen tussle to get on this list&#133; 
    They knew it would not save anyone - but who wanted to be saved? Infinitely 
    more important was to give through the Tribunal a straight answer to the imperialist 
    rulers. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The charge is wrong,&quot; young Kartar 
    Singh Sarabha told the court in even and balanced words; the judges pricked 
    their ears, &quot;yes, ours was not a conspiracy, it was an open challenge 
    to the powers that rule this land and we are proud of having made that challenge.&quot; 
    He recounted what slavery had meant to them - poverty and degradation at home, 
    contempt and humiliation abroad. He told them the story of the Komagata Maru, 
    of the birth and growth of the Ghadar Party, of the emergence of the idea 
    of national revolt. Without fear and without regret he spoke of the unsuccessful 
    struggle they had waged, of the flame they had kindled that would never die 
    out. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kartar and his comrades were speaking to judges 
    higher than those sitting on that raised platform - to their own people. The 
    trial was strictly in camera. No visitors, not even the relatives of the accused 
    were allowed in the court. Nothing but the censored reports went out. Still 
    they knew that the truth would be known one day to their people. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judges listened spellbound. They looked 
    at young Sarabha's handsome pride-flushed face. &quot;Do you know what it 
    means?&quot;, said on of them when Sarabha had finished. &quot;Yes, death,&quot; 
    was the defiant reply. He refused to retract the statement but the judges 
    would not record it and adjourned the court for the day to give him time to 
    think it over. When the court re-assembled the next day, Sarabha had his answer 
    ready, it was the same as he had given before. He would not retract a word. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persuasion was tried in vain. &quot;I have committed 
    no crime, it is the right of the slave to revolt,&quot; were Sarabha's only 
    words. <br>
    The statement was recorded as also those of Sarabha's comrades. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judges retired to the hills to prepare their 
    judgment and the accused returned to their cells. Locked in day and night 
    handcuffed and fettered during the worst hot days of the year they spent another 
    two months. <br>
    On 13th September, they were marched out for the last time to barrack No. 
    16. The Special Tribunal delivered its judgment. <br>
    Twenty-four were sentenced to death with confiscation of property. These included 
    Kartar Singh Sarabha (Ludhiana), Jagat Singh (Lahore), Harnam Singh (Sialkot), 
    Pingley (Maharashtra), Bakhshish Singh (Amritsar), Surain Singh (Amritsar) 
    and another named Surain Singh (all hanged later on), Sohan Singh Bhakna (Amritsar), 
    Kesar Singh (Amritsar), Nidhan Singh Chuga (Ferozepur), Parmanand (Jhansi), 
    Jagat Ram (Hoshiarpur), Harnam Singh Tundilat (Hoshiarpur), Prithvi Singh 
    (Ambala), Nand Singh (Ludhiana), and others. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another 26 were sentenced to transportation 
    for life with confiscation of property. These included Jwala Singh (Amritsar), 
    Wasakha Singh (Amritsar), Rur Singh (Ferozepur), Udham Singh Kasel (Amritsar) 
    - later killed in Kabul - Gurmukh Singh (Ludhiana), Sher Singh (Amritsar) 
    and Madan Singh Gaga (Lahore). <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six others were given varying sentences. The 
    rest were released only to be re-arrested at the jail gate and tried in the 
    next case. Among these was Baba Gujjar Singh later sentenced to transportation 
    for life. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those sentenced to be hanged 15 had been 
    arrested aboard before they set foot on Indian soil. Of the rest only three 
    were involved in the death of a policeman during an armed clash. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could be no judicial appeal and very few 
    agreed to appeal for mercy. On the day fixed for the execution, buckets of 
    water were placed before the condemned cells. They took their bath and said 
    their prayers. Each was eager to mount the gallows first. To those who came 
    to sympathize with them they simply said, &quot;How better can a man lay down 
    his life than in the cause of his country's freedom?&quot; So they waited 
    for death. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they waited in vain. Next morning the Superintendent 
    told them that the execution had been stayed. <br>
    Those were the days of O'Dwyer - of terror on the one hand and rampant toadyism 
    on the other. Today Sikhs like Sir Sundar Singh Majithia and Sardar Bahadur 
    Gajjan Singh declared that the Ghadar heroes had blackened the fair record 
    of Sikhs by their disloyalty and got it declared from the Akal Takht - the 
    highest religious sect of Sikhs - that they were no Sikhs. But the conscience 
    of the common man was shocked by the ferocity of the sentences and the demand 
    for their revision gathered strength despite severe bans and censorship. The 
    death sentences of 17 were commuted to transportation for life. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mourning continued to hang over the Lahore 
    Central Jail. Even the ordinary prisoners moved about with tears in their 
    eyes. Kartar Singh Sarabha was still to die. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early on the morning of 19th November, 
    1915, Kartar and his 6 comrades were taken out. They mounted the gallows singing 
    and smiling and showed their executioners how Indian revolutionaries die. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eve of his execution Kartar Singh was 
    again asked to appeal for mercy. &quot;If I had to live more lives than one,&quot; 
    he said, &quot;I would sacrifice each of them for my country's sake.&quot;<br>
    Pt. Jagat Ram sang:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Behold on the second of Maghar, 1972 the 
    heroes of the army of Ghadar seek fulfillment on the gallows; Hail, O immortal 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kartar, warriors shall vow in your<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name when going into future battles!&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Altogether 9 cases were tried by the Special 
    Tribunals constituted under the Defense of India Act. In the Punjab, the U.P., 
    Bengal and Burma, 28 revolutionaries were hanged and many more transported 
    for life. Dr. Harnam Singh and Sohan Lal Pathak were hanged in the Mandalay 
    Conspiracy Case together with 4 of their comrades. Hardit Singh, Vir Singh, 
    Kapur Singh and many others were sentenced to transportation for life. As 
    Sohan Lal stepped on to the gallows he was made yet another and last offer 
    to repent and seek mercy. He smiled and calmly answered back, &quot;With tyranny 
    and injustice all on your side, it is you who should beg forgiveness.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In between these trails, summary trails and 
    executions were ordered of the Ghadar Guerilla bands. About 30 were hanged 
    in Lahore Central Jail and their dead bodies were refused to their relatives. 
    Among those hanged was Kanshi Ram. <br>
    Balwant Singh Granthi, leader of the Ghadar Party in Canada was hanged in 
    Singapore Jail, Dr. Mathra Singh was hanged in the British Embassy at Meshed, 
    Iran. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Michael O'Dwyer says in his book India as 
    I know it,<br>
    &quot;175 accused were brought before Special Tribunals which dealt with general 
    conspiracies as apart from the separate outrages&#133; 38 were sentenced to 
    death (18 commuted to life transportation later), 58 transported for life, 
    58 transported or imprisoned for shorter periods.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 130th Baluch Regiment had unsuccessfully 
    mutinied in Rangoon at the end of January. Later, in February 1915 the 5th 
    Infantry held the fort of Singapore for full one week. It was only with Japanese 
    and Russian assistance that the British broke their resistance. Hundreds were 
    shot. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were ordinary trials as also court marshals. 
    Soldier participants in the conspiracy were shot at Meerut and a few of the 
    7th Rajput Regiment were hanged in Delhi. Another 12 of the Risala No. 23 
    led by Havildar Lachman Singh met their fate in the Ambala Jail. Among these 
    latter was one Abdullah, the only Muslim accused. The C.I.D. did its best 
    to make Abdullah betray his &quot;kafir&quot; comrades. &quot;It is with these 
    men alone that the gates of Heaven shall open to me,&quot; was the only answer 
    they got out of him.<br>
    The Ghadar revolt had failed. The Punjab had a veritable bloodbath. Countless 
    men died on the gallows and before the firing squads. They died like heroes 
    - but remained unwept and unsung. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when the leaders of the Indian national 
    movement were talking of &quot;self-government on British dominion model&quot; 
    the heroes of the Ghadar Party had dared to raise the banner of complete independence, 
    of armed revolt against imperialism. <br>
    The revolt was drowned in blood, but the flame had been kindled. The Ghadar 
    revolutionaries could proudly look around from the gallows and still say, 
    in the words of the English poet, Byron:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Still freedom's banner torn yet flying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streams like a thunderstorm against the wind.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The Andamans<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the afternoon of 10th December 1915, 18 men 
    handcuffed and fettered in twos alighted from S.S. Maharaja at Port Blair 
    in the Andamans. Among them were men whose ages varied from 22 to 60. The 
    laws provided that no one above the age of forty could be transported. Such 
    rules seemed to have been contemptuously waived in this case. This was the 
    first batch of the &quot;dangerous prisoners&quot; of the First Lahore Conspiracy 
    Case. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the prison gates they were met by the Jailor. 
    He looked up and down a the new men given into his power for the next 20 years 
    and jeered, &quot;Raj lenewala log. Raj mangta raj? Raj nehin koloo (oil mill) 
    dega.&quot; The tired and exhausted prisoners looked at the round plump Jailor 
    and burst into peals of laughter. Such defiance of the lord of the island 
    on the very first day! Red in the face, Jailor Barry was trembling with rage. 
    Yes, the Government of India was right, these men had to be broken. The prisoners 
    were divided over the 740 cells in the 7 blocks of the three-storied Andamans 
    prison. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoners knew that Andamans meant hell 
    and they had already vowed to fight back. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very first day they refused to be harnessed 
    to the koloo - the most brutal type of hard labor. The Jailor knowingly smiled 
    and asked them to do &quot;easier labor&quot; and separate nine chattaks of 
    coconut fibers. He knew that they could not do it and so it happened. Young 
    Parmanand of Jhansi was called up for explanation. The smile on his face annoyed 
    Barry who abused and tried to hit him. Parmanand hit back in self-defense. 
    He was beaten unconscious by the warders and thrown into a cell. <br>
    Next day even as the entire prison was acclaiming him, Parmanand bleeding 
    and in rags was carried out of his cell and flogged under the orders of the 
    Superintendent, Major Murray. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His comrades struck work. The Chief Commissioner 
    who came went about threatening to hog everyone. On each prisoner's ticket 
    was entered, &quot;6 months solitary confinement, danda berry, penal diet, 
    and standing handcuffs for a week.&quot; The battle began. <br>
    Other batches of the prisoners of the Ghadar Conspiracy now reached the Andamans 
    and joined in their struggle. But Barry and Murray claimed to have beaten 
    tougher men into submission; and the struggle continued. Prisoners began to 
    be deliberately starved, the sick remained uncared for and the thirsty were 
    refused water. Even the peaceful and saintly Wasakha Singh sang out against 
    the &quot;three tyrants of the Andamans.&quot; News of the struggle reached 
    the Indian Government. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burra Sahibs at Delhi who got their report from 
    the Murrays and Barrys eased their conscience by calling these heroic revolutionaries 
    &quot;a pack of wolves&quot; and declared the subject closed. They would not 
    intervene. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Andamans the terror increased. Refusal 
    to work on Sundays was &quot;disobedience.&quot; To complain of injustice 
    was to make &quot;baseless allegations against responsible jail officials 
    with malicious intent&quot;. The washing of hair with an indigenous stuff 
    in the absence of soap and tap water was a &quot;breach of prison discipline.&quot; 
    Punishment followed in each case; handcuffs and fetters, gunny clothes, solitary 
    confinements and bread and water became a part of their daily routine. The 
    prisoners knew that sturdy physiques of men like Ashutosh Lahiri had first 
    been carefully broken inside the prison before they were flogged for non-fulfillment 
    of their quota of hard labor. And they fought on all the more determined and 
    all the more desperately. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now 60-year-old Baba Bhan Singh died. He was 
    severely beaten and had succumbed two days later. More martyrs began to die 
    at their posts. Budha Singh, Ram Rakha, Rullia Singh, Nand Singh, Kehar Singh, 
    Natha Singh, Roda Singh - all fell one after another; but abandoned and forgotten 
    by their people, these heroes fought on - their backs to the wall. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four years thus passed. Thrice did Sohan Singh 
    Bhakna resort to hunger strike. Prithvi Singh hunger-struck for 155 days and 
    spent 20 months in solitary confinement. Jwala Singh lived imprisoned in cages 
    for years, Rur Singh stood chained to the walls for weeks on end, young Gurmukh 
    Singh defied all these grueling tortures, but refused to submit. Separately 
    confined in their cells they all fought - they all suffered. It was an epic 
    of superhuman endurance, of matchless heroism. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole prison saw these handful of men playing 
    with their lives to defy the trio of tyrants who ruled the Andamans and cried 
    out, &quot;Sabas Bombwala.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then victory come. Through some Punjabi soldiers 
    the news at last got to India. A storm of protest swept over the land. The 
    Andamans had to be closed down. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 1921, the homeward journey began. Once 
    again they looked through the holes in the sides of the ships. With tears 
    in their eyes they greeted their native land rushing forward to meet them. 
    The cold ashes of eight of their comrades remained in the Andamans. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;A Revolutionary Never Gets Old&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoners were now repatriated to India 
    but they had become too dangerous to be kept together. They were received 
    into different jails, Hazaribagh, Yerawada, Nagpur, Vellore, Coimbatore. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was during these transfers that Prithvi Singh 
    and Gurmukh Singh escaped from running trains. In the meanwhile 15 of their 
    comrades including Baba Wasakha Singh had been released in the amnesty granted 
    at the end of the war. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stuggle, however, did not end even in Indian 
    jails. In Coimbatore they saw the ruthless violence with which the Moplah 
    revolt was being suppressed. Young men were hanged daily. Even little children 
    who had been arrested were left to starve inside the prison. The heart of 
    these heroic Punjabis wept in sympathy for them. Out of their own ration they 
    tried to feed them. Baba Jwala Singh was given 30 lashes for this simple act 
    of humanity. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Yerawada Jail they had to go on hunger strike 
    once again to win pugris for Sikh prisoners. The battle-scarred hero Baba 
    Sohan Singh Bhakna was again in the midst of the struggle when Bhagat Singh 
    and his comrades went on their famous hunger strike in 1929 in the Lahore 
    Central Jail. When he was asked by Bhagat Singh himself not to go on hunger 
    strike because of his old age, his reply was: &quot;What if the body has grown 
    old, a revolutionary never gets old.&quot; And true to his word he remained 
    on hunger strike for a month and a half.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years passed. The usual 14 years of life term 
    were over long ago, but the Government refused to release them, as 14 years 
    had not been long enough to break these men. But Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna refused 
    to submit. &quot;Why continue to cling to life?&quot; he asked and began a 
    fast unto death. Three months passed before the Government agreed to release 
    him unconditionally in 1930. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon afterwards he was arrested in the Congress 
    movement. Coming out again he threw himself into organizing a campaign for 
    the release of political prisoners, specially his old comrades. In the meantime 
    Nand Singh and Chuhar Singh had started a fast unto death. The latter died, 
    only a few days after his release. The whole province was now stirred. At 
    last these veteran warriors after serving as many as 20 years began to pour 
    out of various prisons of the Punjab. Many of them came out having become 
    permanent invalids for the rest of their lives. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was a new world into which they now stepped. 
    It was a world moulded by the first mass Civil Disobedience, the great Akali 
    movement and the young communist Party - the world of Cawnpore and Meerut 
    Conspiracy Cases, of the Kirti Kisan Party. It was the period of the second 
    Civil Disobedience movement, of the great worker, kisan and student mass upsurge 
    that followed in its wake. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victorious Russian Revolution had made Moscow 
    the center of pilgrimage for revolutionaries all over the world. The Ghadar 
    Party in America had also sent its representatives to the first workers' and 
    peasants' state. In its great socialist constructions they saw the birth of 
    a new civilization, something grander and far beyond the narrow horizon of 
    American capitalist democracy. They came over to Communism. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That superb organizer and tireless revolutionary 
    fighter - Santokh Singh - came to India, founded the Kirti, first revolutionary 
    working-class paper in the Punjab and kept it going till he fell a victim 
    to T.B. in 1928. Henceforth a regular stream of Indians educated at the Eastern 
    University in Moscow began to flow into India. These young Ghadarites wanted 
    to play their role in the building up of this new world. </p>
  <p align="left">Into The Struggle Again<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was into this new world that these released 
    men now came. They had gone in young and middle ages but now on their old 
    bodies they carried the scars of innumerable battles, of endless sufferings. 
    They had stood under the gallows, done 20 long years in prisons, undergone 
    grueling tortures and faced death in the dark dungeons of the Andamans. Their 
    bodies were shattered, but they were not to pass their old age in peace. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna forgot the way to his 
    home. All that remained of it was an old crumbling structure where his wife 
    would occasionally come to shed tears. But the path of revolution was clearer 
    than ever before. He knew as also his comrades why their revolt in India had 
    failed and why a greater one succeeded in Russia. And had he not himself said, 
    &quot;a revolutionary dies, he never grows old&quot;? They now gathered under 
    the Red Flag. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They not only found their old comrades but with 
    true revolutionary devotion they all lined up with comrades half their age 
    and very often younger. A new chapter in their lives began. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna by building up the congress 
    in his area was elected to its Provincial Committee. Walking miles to organize 
    Kisan Sabhas, receiving unflinchingly brutal lathi blows at Amritsar (1938) 
    on his age-stiffened bones, he rose to be the President of the All-India Kisan 
    Sabha. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baba Jwala Singh who roused the peasants, organized 
    Kisan Sabhas all over the province, carried the Red Flag even into the dark 
    feudal belt of the Nili Bar and died in harness - is today immortal in the 
    Punjab kisan movement. <br>
    Baba Rur Singh, always on his feet, rousing the peasants of Ferozepur and 
    the down-trodden tenants of the Kalisa State, leading their victorious campaigns, 
    one after another, was elected without opposition by the people of Moga Tehsil 
    to the Punjab Legislature. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baba Kesar Singh, fighting heroically together 
    with Baba Sher Singh against wild imperialist repression to keep the Kirti 
    going, at the head of every kisan struggle, among the first to be clapped 
    into jail in the famous Lahore Morcha in 1939, has today spent more than 33 
    years of his life in jail. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baba Wasakha Singh, sublime and saintly founder 
    of the Desh Bhagat Pariwar Sahaik Committee (a committee formed to help the 
    families of patriots in prison), fighting since 1921 to defend the political 
    prisoners and aid their families, who rose to be the Jathedar of the Akal 
    Takht, is today the most loved and revered person among the Sikh kisans. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baba Gurmukh Singh, the hero of Komagata Maru 
    and the Andamans struggle, organizer of the Congress in Afghanistan, the man 
    who together with Prithvi Singh defied the dark dungeons and tortures of the 
    Kabul Jail to get back to India from the Soviet Union - is today a legendary 
    figure in the Sikh homeland. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prithvi Singh, the hero of the Andamans battles, 
    living and fighting under half-a-dozen assumed names, has carried the torch 
    of freedom into more than one province of our vast land. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baba Sher Singh, Baba Harnam Singh Tundilat, 
    Baba Lal Singh, heroes of countless battles, put younger men to shame by their 
    undaunted courage and tireless work in building up every patriotic movement 
    in the province. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baba Gujjar Singh, builder of Kisan Sabha, Baba 
    Harnam Singh Komagatamaru, Baba Hardit Singh Lamme and many others are even 
    at their advance ages active fighters for freedom and political leaders of 
    their areas. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With them work their comrades, the co-founders 
    of the Ghadar Party who have kept the flag flying even when most of them had 
    been clapped in the 1914-15 cases. Among them is that veteran fighter Karam 
    Singh Cheema, hero of the Second Akali Conspiracy (1925), founder of the first 
    Sikh revolutionary paper Desh Sewak, convicted in various Congress struggles 
    and the builder of Kirti Kisan movement. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There too is his fellow fighter Bhag Singh Canadian, 
    a leader of the great Akali upsurge, builder of the Sikh League in the early 
    twenties and of the kisan movement in the Doaba during the thirties. There 
    is Baba Bhagwan Singh, the hero of the famous Shahidi Jatha (martyr's squad) 
    which in 1925 toured the whole country torn with communal riots with their 
    message of Hindu-Muslim unity and freedom, and won applause from the entire 
    patriotic India led by Pandit Nehru. Among them again is Santa Singh Gandiwind, 
    one of then first to bring to his people the new light of Socialism. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are, apart from Santokh Singh and 
    Jwala Singh, other heroes like Isher Singh Marhana, Nidhan Singh Chuga, Karam 
    Singh Dhut, Madan Singh Gaga, Kapur Singh Mohi and Inder Singh Sursingh who, 
    old and ill, still fought on and unflinchingly laid down their lives, but 
    did not let the flame, for which their comrades had hung at the gallows, flicker 
    out. <br>
    Together they are still building up a tradition of patriotism and self-sacrifice 
    which any freedom movement of the world would feel proud of. </p>
  <p align="left">Over To Communism<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second World War started in September 1939. 
    For the imperialists, the Babas had all along been marked men. Most of them 
    had spent only 3 to 4 years outside the prison since they first came out. 
    They were all again arrested in the first war round up of June 1940. In October, 
    they were sent together with other kisan leaders of the Communist Party of 
    India. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Babas had already come over to the Red Flag 
    and Socialism but it was in Deoli that they undertook the most serious study 
    of Socialist theory and a critical evaluation of their crowded past. They 
    grappled with new ideas and once again came out victorious. Having dedicated 
    their lives for the freedom of the motherland they felt more keenly than many 
    younger men that need for all revolutionary fighters to work together as one 
    disciplined army of revolution. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning shame of being slaves had led them 
    to revolutionary struggle. The influence of the Soviet Union coupled with 
    their tenacity of purpose and love for their people led them during the thirties 
    to organize the great kisan movement in the Punjab. With their undying devotion 
    to the cause of revolution it was but natural that they should join the Communist 
    Party - that great brotherhood of all revolutionaries - to fight for the freedom 
    of their country and happiness of its people. &quot;It is the logic of our 
    whole life-struggle,&quot; said Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna when joining the Party. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the famous hunger strike at Deoli 
    Camp not all the entreaties of the comrades could keep them back. It needed 
    a party mandate to stop some of them from giving up water too. The notorious 
    concentration camp was closed down but the vindictive bureaucracy refused 
    to release them. The Babas were among the last to be released, Rur Singh coming 
    out as late as October 1945. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prithvi Singh, after years of underground struggle, 
    surrendered to the Police on Gandhiji's Ashram after his release. Arrested 
    again in 1942, he was released in 1943. He is again like his other comrades 
    back at his post inside the Party. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one of the greatest among them, Baba Gurmukh 
    Singh, continues to rot behind the prison walls; learning Marxism in the Soviets, 
    reorganizing the Ghadar Party in America and fighting underground in India 
    - he kept the fire of revolution burning among his people till he was arrested 
    in 1936. Lodged in the worst cell in the Lahore Fort, notorious for its inhuman 
    tortures, Gurmukh Singh, now old and gray fought back with all the ferocity 
    of his youth. Not one C.I.D. officer dared to interrogate him. Anxious to 
    launch a new case for escaping from custody, for &quot;new conspiracies,&quot; 
    the police kept him for some months in the Fort. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end they decided merely to send him 
    back to the Andamans to complete his life sentence. They feared that a new 
    trial would be used by Gurmukh Singh as a powerful indictment of the British 
    rule in India and would secure international publicity. <br>
    In the Andamans, Gurmukh Singh led the historic hunger strike which once again 
    smashed the Andamans. Gurmukh Singh and his comrades were repatriated. Since 
    then the veteran hero has been languishing in the Punjab jails. Faced by stupid 
    and vindictive pinpricks, Gurmukh Singh fights on - a terror to all jail authorities. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already served 17 years - but he is a 
    man the Punjab Unionists dread more than anyone else and they refuse to release 
    him. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another comrade of theirs, Baba Sucha Singh 
    is doing the thirteenth year of his life-term in the Hazaribagh Jail. <br>
    Such are the facts about the Ghadar Party and its heroes, the comrades of 
    the immortal Sarabha - who have themselves become legends in the Sikh kisan 
    homes. 20 to 33 years of their lives they have spent inside the worst prisons 
    our rulers have built. They have given their all and suffered everything in 
    the fight for our country's freedom. They are the embodiment of our people's 
    unbreakable will to freedom. They are men of whom any country would be proud.
