  <div align="left"><font color="#993300">This paper discusses the challenges 
    that immigrant Sikhs faced in the United States. It explores the Sikh strategy 
    of accommodating or acculturating to American society. It presents the argument 
    that this acculturation leads to a lack of cultural awareness of Sikhs on 
    the part of the general public. Furthermore, comparison of two communities, 
    one which has successfully increased the public's awareness through active 
    involvement and one which has not been able to do so, successfully argues 
    for a link between the public's understanding of a culture, and the occurrence 
    of hate crimes. The aftermath of the attack of September 11th serve as unique 
    opportunity to measure this connection because at the time Sikhs became the 
    victims of hate crimes due to mistaken identity. <br>

  <div align="left"><font color="#993300">The hate crimes that occurred in the 
    United States after the terrorist attacks on September 11th, resulted in a 
    new perspective of the roles of Sikhs as Americans. Due to the lack of understanding 
    of Sikhism on the part of mainstream Americans, Sikh Americans fell victim 
    to mistaken identity and hate crimes. Although the Sikh American community 
    has maintained a strong religious identity, they continue to live insular 
    lives. <br>

  <div align="left"><font color="#993300">The experiences of Sikh Americans after 
    September 11th, can be compared to those of Chinese Americans after the attack 
    on Peal Harbor by the Japanese. Like Sikh Americans today, these communities 
    also fell victim to mistaken identity due to a lack of cultural awareness. 
    These minorities were forced to identity and differentiate themselves from 
    the Japanese. The lack of cultural awareness is the reason for backlash against 
    Sikh Americans. Since September 11th, the need to address this issue is greater 
    than ever. <br>

    <br>

  <div align="left"><font color="#993300"> Sikhs have been in the United States 
    for over 100 years, and yet there continues to be a lack of cultural awareness 
    of the community. Although they do maintain strong ties to their culture and 
    religion, Sikhs live insular lives. These insular lives, which fail to educate 
    the American society, have resulted in a backlash against Sikh Americans. 
    This lack of cultural awareness had manifested itself in mistaken identity 
    that caused the hate crimes committed against Sikh Americans this year.<br>
    <br>

  <div align="left"><font color="#993300"> The Sikh American community, due to 
    the strong desire for success, has proven to be willing to accommodate to 
    American culture and still maintain a Sikh identity. Sikhs practice their 
    religion within their temples and homes, and Sikh Americans have been able 
    to successfully establish themselves financially as well. Gibson's accommodation 
    without assimilation theory can also be applied to Sikh Americans today. The 
    lack of cultural awareness of this community along with the strong attendance 
    at Gurdwaras illustrates this concept even today. <br>

  <div align="left"><font color="#993300">Today's Sikh organizations have proven 
    to be true advocates for the rights of Sikh Coalition have done a tremendous 
    amount of work after September 11th to prevent further backlash against the 
    Sikh American community such as presentations to local, state, and federal 
    agencies as well as airports. In fact, SMART has been doing similar work for 
    over 10 years through media outreach and various publications. The outreach 
    to the general public, however, is dependent on the involvement of Sikh individuals 
    in their respective local communities. For example, the distribution of the 
    pamphlet "Who are the Sikhs", published by SMART, is largely contingent upon 
    the initiative of individuals. According to Manjit Singh, organizations such 
    as SMART can act like a catalyst, which encourages the Sikh community to become 
    involved. Therefore, these organizations are excellent resources for the spread 
    of cultural awareness, as long as individuals take it upon themselves and 
    become involved. <br>

  <div align="left"><font color="#993300">In Yuba City, PAHS has done a great 
    amount of work to help spread awareness of the Sikh community. Through annual 
    events such as a festival which celebrates the birth of Sikhism, the Sikh 
    and non-Sikh communities are living among one another with an understanding 
    of each culture. These active efforts have created a community which has a 
    strong understanding of Sikhism. The cultural awareness of Sikhism and its 
    followers in Yuba City is apparent in the lack of hate crimes after September 
    11th. Although there is a large population of Sikhs in Yuba City, they have 
    done an excellent job in becoming involved in their local community. In comparison, 
    the individual-dependent programs in New York have not been successful in 
    eliminating the general public's ignorance about Sikhs. <br>

  <div align="left"><font color="#993300">The link between the lack of cultural 
    awareness and hate crimes can also be drawn from the experience of Chinese 
    Americans. This community suffered through discrimination due to mistaken 
    identity after the attack of Peal Harbor by the Japanese. The strong anti-Japanese 
    sentiment which resulted was also directed toward the Chinese American community, 
    who felt the need to identify and differentiate themselves from the Japanese 
    in order to avoid negative sentiment. The Chinese fell victim to mistaken 
    identity once again in the 1980's when trade between Japan and the U.S. was 
    faltering. Vincent Chin is the perfect example of Chinese American who was 
    mistaken for a Japanese and killed due to the lack of cultural awareness. 
    The experiences of Chinese Americans during these times is parallel to that 
    of Sikh Americans after September 11th. Both demonstrate the importance of 
    cultural awareness and its link to mistaken identity which can lead to hate 
    crimes. <br>

  <div align="left"><font color="#993300">The terrorist attack on September 11th 
    made it clear that it is important to study the role of Sikhs in the United 
    States. This paper had moved in that direction by providing the link between 
    the lack of cultural awareness and hate crimes. Further research is needed 
    on the role of Sikh Americans in their respective communities before and after 
    September 11th. In particular, further analysis can be made as to the effectiveness 
    of educational programs dependent on actions led by organizations versus Sikh 
    individuals. Policy studies examining various methods of encouraging public 
    understanding of Sikhism would be useful in light of the backlash against 
    Sikh Americans. <br>
