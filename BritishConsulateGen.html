<p><strong>No. 154</strong></p>
<p align="right"><strong>May 1, 1917</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sir:</strong></p>
<p><strong> In reply to your recent enquiry regarding the publication of the &ldquo;GADAR&rdquo; newspaper and other seditious literature, I have to say that as far as I can learn the work of the &ldquo;GADAR&rdquo; press has been stopped voluntarily.</strong></p>
<p><strong> The Dietrich Attorney informs me that the United States Law does not give him power to prohibit the issue of these papers, but only to stop their carriage through the United States halls(?).</strong></p>
<p><strong> I have ascertained that the printing office on Valencia Street is locked up, and nothing is being done there. This was closed at the time of the split between Ran Chandra and Bhagwan Singh, and has only sporadically worked since then. Bhagwan Singh himself is in prison in ?, Arizona so there is no head to his section of the party. In all probability the other section is without funds, as when this split occurred, a great many of the Hindus ceased subscribing to Ram Chandra&rsquo;s fund, but I will make enquiries about this and will advise you later.</strong></p>
