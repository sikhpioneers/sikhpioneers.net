    <tr> 
      <td> <b>In the year 1900 the census reported 2050 people from India on the 
        North American continent. The majority of these people were Punjabis who 
        had settled in Canada. They had come with the hope of finding work so 
        that they could improve their economic situation from what it had been 
        in the Punjab. Upon arrival in Canada they encountered numerous hardships 
        and discrimination. Canadians wanted the "brown invasion" to stop. They 
        felt that the growing number of Indians would take over their jobs in 
        factories, mills and lumber yards. 
        <P> It was these insecurities which led British Columbia to pass stringent 
          laws discouraging the immigration of Indians to Canada. Indians had 
          to have at least $200 on their person to enter British Columbia and 
          had to have come via direct passage from India. These were very unreasonable 
          laws as the average Indian only earned about ten cents a day. The Canadian 
          government was also pressuring steamship companies to stop selling tickets 
          to Indians. In 1907 a bill was passed denying all Indians the right 
          to vote. They were prohibited to run for public office, serve on juries, 
          and were not permitted to become accountants, lawyers or pharmacists. 
          All this was done to stop the "brown Invasion." On the other hand Japanese 
          and Chinese were immigrating in unlimited numbers. 
        <P> In 1914 the Komagata Maru was an outright challenge to these exclusionist 
          laws. The <a href="s_komaphot.html#komamaru"> Komagata Maru </a> was 
          a Japanese steamliner chartered by an affluent businessman,<A NAME="gurdit"></A><A href="s_komaphot.html#gsingh"> 
          Gurdit Singh</A>, to bring Indian immigrants to Canada. The ship's <a href="marumap.html">route 
          </a> departed from Hong Kong, stopped in Japan and then headed to Canada. 
          Its passengers included 376 Indians, all Punjabis, among whom 340 were 
          Sikhs, 12 Hindus, and 24 Muslims. The ship was eventually turned back 
          at Vancouver where landing was refused, and terminated eventually at 
          Calcutta. 
        <P> 
        <BLOCKQUOTE>"Bhai Gurdit Singh, Bhai Daljit Singh and his friend Bhai 
          Vir Singh from Ferozepur were staying in the Sikh Temple of Hong Kong 
          in 1914. The story of Chief Justice Hunter's judgment in Victoria, B.C., 
          about the release of 39 Asian Indians was on everybody's lips. The emigrants 
          were overjoyed. Bhai Daljit Singh began selling tickets for departures 
          to Canada. However, the British Government of Hong Kong was watching 
          the activities of Bhai Gurdit Singh because the charter of Komagata 
          Maru was in his name. Two days before the ship was to sail, Bhai Gurdit 
          Singh was arrested by Hong Kong police on the charge of illegally selling 
          tickets for an illegal voyage and the ship placed under police guard. 
          The Sikh Police of Hong Kong were often used to terrorize prospective 
          emigrants. 
          <P> "Bhai Gurdit Singh was released on bail on March 24, 1914. Mr. Severn, 
            chief secretary for the Governor of Hong Kong, was known to Bhai Gurdit 
            Singh while he was in Malaya. Mr. Severn told Singh that he had been 
            waiting instructions from England and Canada, which never arrived. 
            The governor granted Singh permission for passage on April 4, 1914. 
          <P> "That very day Komagata Maru left Hong Kong with 150 passengers. 
            On April 8 at Shanghai, 111 emigrants boarded the ship, and on April 
            14, at the Port of Moji, 86, at the Yokohama port, 14 more passengers 
            boarded the Komagata Maru totalling 376 passengers. From Moji, Bhai 
            Gurdit Singh took 1500 tons of coal to sell in Canada and had intended 
            to buy lumber from B.C. to sell back in the East. Finally, the Komagata 
            Maru left Yokohama on May 3, 1914. 
          <P> "[There were words of caution from several quarters to the passengers.] 
            Bhai Balwant Singh travelled in the Komagata Maru from Moji to Kobe 
            and explained to the passengers the attitude of the British Government 
            of India, Britain, and Canada towards their mission. Gyani Bhagwan 
            Singh, who was forcibly deported from Canada on November 19, 1913, 
            also the passengers at Yokohama and told them the story of his own 
            deportation. Mahamad Barkatullah, the great teacher, who was professor 
            of Hindustani in the University of Tokyo, also met the passengers 
            of Maru in Yokohama. 
          <P> When Komagata Maru made it to Shanghai, a German cable company sent 
            a message to the German press announcing the departure of the steamer 
            Komagata Maru from Shanghai for Vancouver on April 14 with "400 Indians 
            on board..." 
          <P> "The news was picked up by British press. The Vancouver daily "Province", 
            published the inflammatory news report under the heading of "Boat 
            Loads of Hindus on Way to Vancouver". The British Columbia press began 
            giving such headlines to their articles as "Hindu Invasion of Canada". 
            <a href="#kesar">*</a> 
        </BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P> The news of its departure reached the British Columbia authorities. 
          Their instant reaction was that "Hindus would never be allowed to land 
          in Canada." The Indians who had already settled in Canada had also started 
          to prepare for the arrival of the Komagata Maru. Meetings were held 
          in the Gurdwaras concerning what actions to take. Money and provisions 
          were collected to help the passengers upon their arrival in Vancouver. 
          The entire Indian community in Canada united to fight the opposition. 
        <P> On May 23, 1914, the Komagata Maru reached Vancouver and anchored 
          near Burrard Inlet. Both the Indians and the Canadian authorities had 
          been waiting for it. The Canadians wanted to send the ship back to where 
          it had originated. The Indians on the other side had lawyers, money 
          and other provisions ready to help the passengers. The Canadian authorities 
          did not let the passengers leave the boat claiming they had violated 
          the exclusionist laws. The claim was that the ship had not arrived via 
          direct passage and most passengers did not have the $200 that would 
          have qualified them to enter British Columbia. For two months the passengers 
          of the Komagata Maru, the Indians in British Columbia, and the authorities 
          of British Columbia were involved in a heated legal battle. At the end 
          of the two months only 24 passengers were given permission to legally 
          stay in Canada. On July 23, 1914 the Komagata Maru was forced to leave 
          Victoria harbor and return to Hong Kong. (See <a href="#johnston">Johnston</a>

        <P> <I>Returned Passengers from Vancouver aboard the Komagata Maru in 
          Budge-Budge Harbor.</I> <BR>
          (Source: Punjab and Sind Bank Calendar for 1989.) 
        <P> The Komagata Maru approached Calcutta on September 26, 1914. As it 
          approached Calcutta, a European gunboat signaled the ship to stop. The 
          ship was put under guard and the passengers were held as prisoners. 
          Then the Komagata Maru was taken to a place called Budge Budge, about 
          seventeen miles away from its original destination of Calcutta. These 
          new developments took the passengers of the ship by surprise. After 
          two months of litigation in Canada they were not interested in any new 
          developments of this kind. Upon inquiry by Baba Gurdit Singh as to the 
          change of their course, an official informed him that the passengers 
          were being sent to Punjab via a special train. Many of the passengers 
          did not want to go to Punjab. They had business to attend to in Calcutta, 
          some wished to look for work there, and most importantly, the passengers 
          wanted to place the Guru Granth Sahib, which they had taken with them 
          on their journey, in a Calcutta Gurdwara. 
        <P> The British officials did not care what the passengers wanted. They 
          were going to be put on a train to Punjab and that would be the end 
          of it. But the passengers were adamant on going to Calcutta. They were 
          the rightful owners of the ship and the British officials had no reason 
          to keep them on the ship or send them to Punjab. They felt that some 
          action had to be taken, so they decided to march to Calcutta. 
        <p> Their main purpose on reaching Calcutta was to hand over the holy 
          Guru Granth Sahib and to see the governor. The journey was long and 
          after numerous threats by the police, they were left with no choice 
          but to head back to Budge Budge. At Budge Budge, they were ordered to 
          board the ship once again. The passengers, led by Baba Gurdit Singh, 
          refused. A policeman attacked Baba Gurdit Singh with his baton but was 
          stopped by a fellow passenger. It was at this point that firing started. 
          Baba Gurdit Singh was carried to safety. But not all passengers were 
          to be so fortunate. Twenty-nine fell victim to the bullets of British 
          officials and 20 died. Here was another senseless massacre of innocent 
          Indians at the hands of the British. The was the tragic end of the passengers 
          of the Komagata Maru.<a href="#kesar">See Kesar Singh,<I>Canadian Sikhs</I></a>

        <P> World War I 
        <P> The Komagata Maru returned to India's waters on September 26, 1914, 
          leaving behind only twenty-four passengers who could prove residence 
          in Canada. The repercussions of the Government's actions - the Budge 
          Budge riot. The radicalization of those abroad, the vigilante action 
          against informers, the murder of Hopkinson, the execution of Mewa Singh, 
          were overshadowed by the outbreak of World War I, in August 1914.
