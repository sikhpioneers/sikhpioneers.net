<P> Gadar means "revolution," and in a word it describes what the movement hoped 
  to achieve: the overthrow of British rule and the establishment of India's independence. 
  It was founded in the early decades of this century by expatriate Punjabis on 
  the west coast of the U.S. and Canada; its bases of operations were in San Francisco 
  and the San Joaquin valley. The movement has been a source of continuing fascination 
  among scholars, not only because its quixotic ventures are interesting in themselves 
  but also because Gadar has had an impact in both it Indian and American contexts. 
</P>
<P><B>Gadar as Revolutionary Movement </B></P>
<P>The history of Gadar is full of adventure, intrigue, and high drama: it involves 
  shiploads of munitions aimed at India, secret deals with international agents, 
  and an inflammatory propaganda machine. For this reason much of the interest 
  in Gadar and the research on it is directed towards the organization and activities 
  of the movement itself. Most of the accounts of Gadar cover the brief span of 
  years from 1913 to 1917, beginning with the arrival of the central figure of 
  the movement, Lala Har Dayal, as a visiting professor at Stanford University 
  and ending with the tragic conspiracy trial in San Francisco four years later. 
</P>
<P>* Unfortunately, very few of the records of the original organization have 
  survived. When the building that housed the Gadar headquarters at 5 Wood Street 
  in San Francisco was demolished in the 1950s, what records remained in the building 
  were taken to the home of a Punjabi family living on a farm near Davis, California. 
  Soon thereafter a fire swept through the house and the records were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>Many of the publications of the movement are still available, however. These 
  include the newspaper, the <I>Hindustan Gadar</I> [765]*, from which the organization 
  received its name, a series of pamphlets, <I>Gadar-di-Gunj</I> [353], articles 
  by Har Dayal [342-7], and a number of tacts [326, 358]. Most of these were written 
  in Panjabi or Urdu and were aimed at rousing support from the Punjabi community 
  in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Some pamphlets, however, 
  were aimed at a different audience: sympathetic Americans. These writings, printed 
  in English, include <I>A Few Facts About British Rule</I> [351], reprints of 
  American criticism of the British [337, 372] and an open letter to President 
  Wilson [338]. </P>
<P>Most of the publications, regardless of language, preached the same message: 
  the evils of colonial rule and the need for independence. There was little hint, 
  however, of what sort of government the revolutionaries wanted in its place. 
  The Gadar constitution [362, 364] indicated only a general respect for parliamentary 
  order. The title of a later Gadar newspaper, <I>The United States of India</I> 
  [781], suggests an American model of democracy; and the Marxist model was embraced 
  by some of the Gadarites who returned to India from America after 1917 via the 
  Soviet Union. The aspirations of a Marxist Gadarites, Sohan Singh Bhakna, are 
  described in a biography [426], and the progressive political and social ideas 
  of Har Dayal are to be found in his articles [342-7], his published volume of 
  letters [274], and in biographies about him by Emily Brown [265] and Dharmavira 
  [275]. </P>
<P>The organization of the Gadar movement is, like its ideology, only partially 
  revealed through its publications. The government reports - the British India 
  Office files, the U.S. government investigations [132-4] and records of the 
  conspiracy trial kept at the U.S. National Archives and Records Center in San 
  Bruno, California - give additional information on Gadar membership and activities. 
</P>
<P>Several scholarly works published in India rely on interviews and other sources 
  for portrait of the Gadar Party as a revolutionary movement. The differences 
  among some of them indicate differences in the scholars' choices of sources. 
  Deol [416] uses interviews and other materials available in the Punjab, while 
  Mathur [292] relies almost entirely on Indian government documents in Delhi 
  in tracing the intrigues of the party. Bose [262] has tracked down records in 
  London, Berlin, and India. Khushwant Singh and Satindra Singh focus on the Sikh 
  connections [454], as does Randhir Singh [459]. Harish Puri has comprehensively 
  covered Gadar publications, government reports, and interviews available in 
  India, United Kingdom, and the United States, in his analysis of the political 
  aspects of Gadar [438-9]. </P>
<P><B>The Role of Gadar in India's Independence </B></P>
<P>To gain perspective on the role the Gadar movement in India's struggle for 
  independence, it is necessary to expand the narrow time range of 1913 to 1917. 
  This breadth is provided in some of the biographies of Gadar leaders where their 
  involvements with the party are connected with their interest in earlier movements. 
  Har Dayal's break with the Arya Samaj is described in the biographies about 
  him [265-275]. Before he edited the <I>Hindustan Gadar</I>, Ram Chandra was 
  the editor of journals supported by nationalist groups in India [391], and another 
  Gadarite, Bhai Parmanand, was similarly involved [437]. </P>
<P>One of gauging the importance of Gadar as a revolutionary threat is by the 
  magnitude of the British government's response to it. The British concerns are 
  reflected in the reports of police inspectors [400] and in evidence marshalled 
  against Gadar defendants in the Lahore Conspiracy Trial and the Sedition Committee 
  Report of 1918 [399]. Lists of the Gadar literature that the British banned 
  from India are compiled and annotated by N.G. Barrier [255]. </P>
<P>Historians have been of an uncertain mind regarding the importance of Gadar's 
  role in Indian history. The <I>Cambridge History of India</I>, for example, 
  accords it one line, and even that is inaccurate. On the other hand, Majumdar's 
  history of the independence movement [432] devotes almost a hundred pages to 
  Gadar. Banerjee [254] and Bose [262] give excellent assessments of Gadar's participation 
  in the freedom movement. Deol [416] similarly links Gadar with militant nationalists, 
  but his emphasis is on subsequent developments in the movement in the Punjab. 
</P>
<P>The direct effect of the Gadar movement on India's independence is debatable, 
  especially since the Congress movement at the time showed it little favor and 
  was operating with a different style. Gadar is said to have influenced several 
  different nationalist leaders: Lajpat Rai, founder of the "India Home Rule League 
  of America" [469, 304]; Togore [254, 432] (a connection which is refuted by 
  Hay [439]); the Indian Marxist, M. N. Roy [262]; and Subhas Chandra Bose, founder 
  of the Indian National Army [416]. In addition the journalist Durga Das, in<I> 
  India : From Curzon to Nehru</I>, has claimed that Gadar support financed the 
  funding of India's first English-language nationalist newspaper, <I>The Hindustan 
  Times</I>. </P>
<P>The impact of Gadar on politics in the Punjab is even more direct. The biography 
  of Sohan Singh Bhakna [426] and the G. S. Sainsara history [442] indicate the 
  role that returning Gadarites had in the formulation of the Punjab's leftist 
  political groups. The connection between Gadar and Marxist movements in the 
  Punjab are mentioned in my <I>Religion as Social Vision</I> [430], and the links 
  with international Marxism are explored by Gail Omvedt [435]. </P>
<P>Gadarites are claimed as nationalist leaders throughout the Punjab. A link 
  between Gadar and Punjab here Bhagat Singh is made by Josh [285]. Gadar's contribution 
  to the rise of the Akali movement is described in Khushwant Singh's <I>History 
  of the Sikhs</I>, Vol. 2 [453]. Punjab's Scheduled Caste organization, the <I>Ad 
  Dharm Mandal</I>, was also founded by a Gadarite, whose story is found in interviews 
  [440]. </P>
<P>There are almost no studies of the branches of Gadar outside India and North 
  America. Yet we know that some existed in such places as Hong Kong, Manila, 
  Bangkok, Shanghai, and Panama. Other Gadar contacts were to be found in Europe 
  and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. According to some sources [93, 399, 416] the 
  1915 uprising among Punjabi soldiers stationed in Singapore was fomented by 
  Gadarites. Some information is available on Gadar activities in China [405]. 
</P>
<P>India was not the only country mobilizing against British colonialism in the 
  early 1900s, and the Gadar leaders found kinship, especially in Irish revolutionary 
  brotherhood [349]. According to Mrs. Ram Chandra, it was the Irish who defended 
  and supported the Gadarites in California during the difficult days of the San 
  Francisco conspiracy trial in 1917-18 [391]. </P>
<P>Germany was the Gadar movement's most significant -- and damaging ally. The 
  entrance of the United States into World War I made Gadar's dealings with the 
  Germans untimely and precipitated an investigation [314]. In the Gadarites own 
  recollection of the movement [391, 404, 440], the role of the Germans was largely 
  financial. According to Bose [262] and M. N. Roy [306] there were close connections 
  between Gadar and the Indian National Committee in Berlin; the Germans arranged 
  in 1915 for two shiploads of weapons to be supplied to Gadar armies training 
  in Siam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia on the American boats <I>Maverick</I> 
  and <I>Annie Larson</I>. The attempt was aborted by British intervention. </P>
<P>The German connection is the focus of several accounts of Gadar [262, 292, 
  320, 414-5, 461]. Part of the reason for the great interest of historians in 
  the German issue is the availability of sources. The government reports -- including 
  British intelligence [399] and American -- are the most thorough. A great store 
  of material was collected as evidence for the conspiracy trial in San Francisco, 
  which effectively ended the most active years of the Gadar Party. Copies of 
  the court transcript of the trial (<I>The United States vs. Franz Bopp et al.</I>) 
  are available on microfilm [389]. The voluminous materials collected in evidence 
  by the American government for the trial are kept at the West Coast branch of 
  the U.S. government's national archives in San Bruno,California. The major unexplored 
  area for research on the German connection is the archives of the German government. 
</P>
<P><B>The Gadar Chapter of America's Ethnic History </B></P>
<P>The problem of the immigrant community provided much of the impetus for enthusiastic 
  support for the Gadar movement. The new Indian immigrants were not being treated 
  hospitably in the nation of immigrants. Information about the early Indian immigrant 
  community in California may be found in Congressional reports [132-4], and interviews 
  reported in <I>Waiz's Indians Abroad</I>, published in 1927 [139]. And there 
  are a few studies of the Indian immigrant community [160, 197] (see also the 
  proceedings of the Asiatic Exclusion League [8]). The Gadar Party blamed British 
  influence for America's negative attitude toward Indian immigration, and the 
  tragic end of the boatland of Indian immigrants on the <I>Komagata Maru</I> 
  indicates that Canadians were as hostile to the new immigrants as Americans 
  [115]. These difficulties may have fueled the passions of the Gadar movement, 
  and this pattern of ethnic frustration leading to participation in a movement 
  of nationalism back home constitutes what I have described as a syndrome for 
  which Gadar is a prime example [429]. </P>
<P><B>Summary of the Available Sources </B></P>
<P>The original documents, written in Panjabi and Urdu, include as least six newspapers 
  and magazines, thirty pamphlets, and dozens of posters, all printed by the Hindustan 
  Gadar Party. These sources are augmented by the files and records of various 
  government agencies in Great Britain, Canada, and the United States, and firsthand 
  accounts found in some ten autobiographies and thirty interviews with former 
  members of the Gadar Party. There are also newspaper reports from the <I>San 
  Francisco Examiner</I> and <I>Chronicle</I>, and the <I>Vancouver Sun</I>. No 
  official party records are known to have survived, except for those preserved 
  as evidence for the 1917-18 trial. </P>
<P>From these original sources have been written a dozen scholarly books on the 
  Gadar Party, and over thirty articles and chapters in books. These are some 
  ten biographies of Gadar leaders, and over a hundred or more historical and 
  bibliographic works that touch on the Gadar movement in a peripheral way. </P>
<P>Some copies of the original Gadar publications and pictures of its leaders 
  are in the Gadar memorial building which has been constructed on the site of 
  the original headquarters in San Francisco. The largest single collection of 
  original and secondary material in the United States is the Gadar Collection 
  of the South and Southeast Asia Library Service at the University of California, 
  Berkeley. An even larger collection, augmented by microfilm copies of governmental 
  reports, is to be found in the National Archives of the Government of India 
  in New Delhi. The Desh Bhagat Yad Ghar (National Patriots' Memorial Center) 
  in Jullunder, Punjab, has original materials as well. The collections in the 
  India Office Library and the British Library in London are also useful, and 
  include banned Gadar publications. The United States government's records are 
  located in the National Archives and Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., 
  and are on microfilm in many university libraries. The U. S. government collection 
  of evidentiary material for the conspiracy trial is located at the National 
  Archives and Records Center, San Bruno, California. Since the source materials 
  are to be found in various places, including both India and America, those who 
  extensive research on the movement will have to retrace some of the steps of 
  the peripatetic Gadarites themselves. </P>
