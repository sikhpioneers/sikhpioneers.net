  <p class=MsoNormal>Department of History, Simon Fraser University</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><BR>
    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>             </span>The Komagata 
    Maru incident belongs to a racist and narrow-minded past that Canadians have 
    not left far behind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the Spring 
    of 1914, a committee of Sikhs led by Baba Gurdit Singh, a wealthy Sikh from 
    Singapore, chartered the steamer, the Kamagata Maru, to carry Indian emigrants 
    to Canada.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They had a sense of mission, 
    and they called the steamer Guru Nanak Jahaz after the first Sikh Guru.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The Komagata 
    Maru arrived in Vancouver on May 23, 1914 with 376 passengers on board.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>With the exception of 20 returning residents and the ship’s doctor 
    and his family, none of the passengers was allowed to land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Instead, they were detained in Vancouver Harbour.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They remained on the ship for two months until 
    July 23, 1914.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When the passengers 
    would not leave Canadian waters without provisions, Canadian officials tried 
    to seize the ship by force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When that 
    attempt failed, the Canadian government brought a navy cruiser with its guns 
    exposed into Burrard Inlet and anchored it broadside to the Komagata Maru.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>In this atmosphere, Baba Gurdit Singh and his fellow passengers negotiated 
    their departure.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Only when the Canadian government agreed to 
    provision their return voyage did they consent to leave without ever putting 
    a foot ashore in Canada.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Vancouver’s 
    newspaper carried the story of this ship and its passengers on their front 
    pages throughout the summer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Crowds lined 
    the waterfront when the Komagata Maru arrived and they returned to gaze at 
    the ship and its passengers whenever the promise of drama or action heightened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>However, this curiosity and sense of excitement, did not awaken much 
    sympathy among Vancouverites for the ordeal of the passengers or their desire 
    to come to Canada.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For the 
    most of this century, Canada has possessed an exclusionist immigration policy 
    based on race and nationality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 
    policy had its origins in the 1880’s when the Canadian government first imposed 
    a head tax on Chinese immigrants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Over 
    the next forty years, the government erected a variety of barriers to keep 
    Canada a white man’s country, and by the 1920’s it had articulated a policy 
    that remained intact until after the Second World War.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From the 1920’s until the 1950’s, Canada gave 
    preference to immigrants from Britain, France, Ireland, the white Dominions 
    of the British Commonwealth, and the United States, to the exclusion of all 
    other except those from Continental Europe (or the wives and children of Canadian 
    residents).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Only in 
    1962 did Canada announce a new policy free of racial, religious or national 
    discrimination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since then, the composition 
    of our population, especially in major cities, has changed remarkably, and 
    Canadians have been learning to appreciate the very different society created 
    as a result.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a consequence, we 
    are beginning to reassess our past.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Giving attention to the story of the Komagata Maru is part of that 
    process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The passengers 
    on the Komagata Maru thought that they had the right to enter Canada because 
    they were British subjects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If citizenship 
    in the British Empire meant anything, they should have been able to go anywhere 
    in the empire freely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sikh soldiers 
    had served throughout the Empire and the Sikh emigrants, many of whom were 
    veterans of the Indian army, thought that they should be able to work wherever 
    the British flag was flying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the 
    same time, some of them knew that the Canadian government did not concede 
    that right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The principal 
    device used to exclude would be immigrants from India was the Continuous Journey 
    Provision of the Immigration Acts of 1908 and 1910.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Immigration officers, had the authority to 
    refuse entry to anyone who did not come by continuous journey from his or 
    her country of origin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Under pressure 
    from the Canadian government, shipping companies would not sell through tickets 
    from India to Canada, so it was impossible for anyone to come from India and 
    meet the requirements of the Canadian law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Ninety percent 
    of the passengers of the Komagata Maru were Sikhs.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The rest were Hindus and Muslims, but they 
    all came from Punjab, the homeland of the Sikhs.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Except for two women and four children, the passengers were men, 
    most being between the ages of eighteen and thirty.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The main attraction for them to leave their homeland was to find 
    work in Canada at wages that were ten to fifteen times as high as anything 
    that they could earn at home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Some of 
    the passengers came from Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai and Mabila – ports 
    in which they had been waiting for many months for an opportunity to reach 
    North America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Others came directly 
    from their village in Punjab.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As soon 
    as they heard that Baba Gurdit Singh was organizing a voyage t Canada, these 
    villagers traveled by rail to Calcutta and took regularly scheduled passages 
    to catch the Komagata maru at Hong Kong, Shanghai, Moji or Yokohama – ports 
    where the Komagata Maru stopped before crossing the Pacific.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>None of 
    the passengers met the continuous passage requirement because the voyage of 
    the Komagata Maru began in Hong Kong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Baba 
    Gurdit Singh had tried to get a ship out of Calcutta, but agents of the Indian 
    government had prevented it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Baba 
    Gurdit Singh and the organizing committee understood the legal situation, 
    but they believed that they had a strong case and were confided they could 
    succeed if they challenged the Canadian law in court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Most of the other passengers simply believed that they had a right 
    to land in Canada.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The ship 
    left Hong Kong on April 4 and, after stopping at Shanghai, Moji and Yokahama, 
    reached Williams Head, near Victoria, on May 22.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The next morning, when the Komagata Maru dropped anchor in Burrad 
    Inlet, the passengers dressed and prepared to go ashore, but that was not 
    their fate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The immigration officials 
    learned that the voyage was under-funded and immediately began to delay proceedings 
    in the expectation that the ship could be forced to leave before anyone made 
    a decision about the passengers’ right to land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>An installment of $15,000 was due on the charter and the passengers 
    did not have enough food or money on board to sustain a long waiting game.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>While the 
    officials played out this strategy, the passengers went without food and water 
    on several occasions, often for more than twenty-four hours.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the same time, the immigration officials 
    held the passengers incommunicado, refusing to allow anyone to come on board 
    to talk to them, not even the lawyer hired on their behalf.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, the ship remained in harbour, because 
    Vancouver’s Punjabi community raised money to pay for the charter and to send 
    food out to the ship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Between 
    five and six thousand Punjabis had entered Canada before 1908.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many had crossed the border to find work in 
    Washington, Oregon and California, and others had returned to India after 
    working for several years in Canada.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But 
    in 1914, more than two thousand remained in British Columbia.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At least half of them were living in Vancouver 
    where they had built a Sikh Gurdwara under the management of the Khalsa Diwan 
    Society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The executive 
    of the Khalsa Diwan Society took the lead in organizing a Shore Committee 
    to raise money on behalf of the passengers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Within days of the arrival of the Komagata Maru, the Shore Committee 
    raised $5,000 in cash among the Sikhs of Vancouver.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Subsequently, they raised another $20,000 to 
    pay the Japanese ship owners and keep the ship in the harbour.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Finally, 
    after the passengers had been confined on board for a month, the Shore Committee 
    and the immigration department agreed to terms that allowed a test case to 
    go before the courts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Five judges 
    of the British Columbia Court of Appeal heard the arguments at the end of 
    June and, in the first week of July, the court rendered its verdict against 
    the passengers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At this 
    point, the men on the ship said they were willing to give up the battle and 
    go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, another three weeks elapsed 
    before they actually departed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 
    government insisted that the charterers and owners of the ship were responsible 
    for provisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While these groups 
    argued about the costs, the passengers would not leave without supplies for 
    the return trip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Officials 
    interpreted this refusal as a delaying tactic and attempted to gain control 
    of the ship with a police boarding party on the Sea Lion, but the passengers 
    drove them off with a barrage of coal and fire bricks.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The government then brought in the cruiser HMCS Rainbow and aimed 
    its guns at the Komagata Maru.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nevertheless, 
    it was only when officials promised to put provisions on board that the passengers 
    agreed to weigh anchor.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In the early 
    morning of July 23, the Komagata Maru sailed out of Vancouver Harbour with 
    352 passengers still on board.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A large 
    number of spectators stood along the shore above the C. P.R. tracks looking 
    down over Coal Harbour to see the Komagata Maru begin to lift her anchor at 
    5:10 a.m. – a few minutes before sunrise.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>There was a cold nip in the air as they watched the Komagata Maru 
    slide away, with the HMCS Rainbow as her shadow, until the two vessels disappeared 
    around Brockton Point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For the passengers 
    and for their friends on shore it was a bitter and deeply disappointing moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A voyage 
    that begun on April 4, did not end until September 29 when the Komagata Maru 
    docked at Budge, twenty miles downstream from Calcutta.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The passengers had been refused permission 
    to land by the governments of Hong Kong and Singapore and were forced to go 
    all the way back to India, although many might have chosen to look for work 
    elsewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By this time the passengers 
    were fully aware of the political implications of their voyage and they expected 
    to stir up the feelings of their countrymen with this demonstration of the 
    injustice and inequality that existed in the Empire.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Unfortunately, 
    the British government of India saw the men on the Komagata Maru as dangerous 
    political agitators.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When the ship 
    docked at Budge, the police tried to arrest Baba Gurdit Singh and the twenty 
    or so other men that they saw as leaders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>In the process, shots were fired and nineteen of the passengers were 
    killed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some escaped, but the remainder 
    were arrested and imprisoned or sent to their villages and kept under village 
    arrest for the duration of the First World War.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Six months of confinement on board the Komagata Maru ended for most 
    of these passengers in another form of confinement.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In India, 
    the Komagata Maru represents the Indian people’s struggle for independence 
    from the British Empire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In Canada, 
    it is a reminder of a policy of exclusion that for Sikhs and other immigrants 
    from India, lasted more than half a century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The Sikh community has survived and prospered in Canada, despite the 
    prejudice and hostility that the Komagata Maru story typifies.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The community has emerged in the 1980’s with 
    a positive and confident outlook.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 
    a more tolerant Canada, the Komagata Maru remains a powerful symbol for Sikhs, 
    one that other Canadians should understand because it is a part of our history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
