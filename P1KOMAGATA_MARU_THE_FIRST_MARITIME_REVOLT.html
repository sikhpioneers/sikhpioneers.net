<p><strong>On My Style </strong></p>
<p>My strength is unconventional in analyzing the old data with new findings. When the focus is on a tree I can see its muscular grandeur and when it is on the forest then I see its panoramic beauty. A historical event is a valuable study only if it can be connected with the present life. Therefore, sociology, politics and psychology are richly blended with folklores and anecdotes to bring liveliness for the discriminating readers. The scholarly jargons are avoided </p>
<p>The story of Komagata Maru is braided and meshed with various other themes and sub-themes. This article is replete with astute observations and daring conclusions, but supported by facts and figures. In many a places, there may be a need for elaboration, but I maintain a condensed style. The memories and thoughts were stirred up after watching a 90 minute documentary, <strong><em>Continuous Journey </em></strong> on Komagata Maru during the 11 th Punjabi American Festival held in Yuba City , California on Sunday, May 29, 2005 . <strong>I especially went there to see this movie. </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Symbol </strong></p>
<p>Komagata Maru virtually symbolizes the hopes and aspiration of poverty stricken, politically persecuted, and yet adventurous ordinary people. It is the story of 376 Punjabis who left the shores of India at the turn of the 20 th century by perhaps selling their lands or borrowing money. <strong>In fact, this practice continues even to present times! </strong> Let it be emphasized that it was not an organized departure. It happened in ones and twos from India to the British controlled seaports particularly of Hong Kong and Singapore . </p>
<p><strong>Freedom and Dignity </strong></p>
<p>A basic question rises how come the Punjabis were the pioneers in the pursuit of better life? The answer is simple; <strong>the Sikhs were the last to lose their very first Sikh empire </strong>! Though Chatrapati Shiva Ji's successors in the 18 th century extended the Maratha Empire over the declining Mughals, but were stopped short of taking control of Delhi . The Sikh empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh hardly lasted ten years after his death. When Dalip Singh succeeded, the British broke the treaty signed with Ranjit Singh, and fully annexed Punjab in 1849. From the empire builders, the Sikhs were suddenly like the birds with clipped wings. </p>
<p>It is during the foreign travels that Indians realized the indignity suffered. <strong>Actually, even today Indian passports do not command due respect. </strong> One finds it out in unpleasant situations encountered either when stranded during a flight, or in need of a transit visa at a foreign airport. The overseas Punjabis in 1914 were neither citizens of a free India , nor they got the equal treatment as legally available to the British subjects. This story is not a part of any history though India has been free for many years. <strong>Ironically, it is not told even in the schools and colleges of </strong><strong>Punjab </strong><strong>, though the Sikhs have ruled it for over 40 years </strong>. </p>
<p><strong>A Bold Venture </strong></p>
<p>The <strong><em> CONTINUOUS JOURNEY </em></strong> is the first documentary cum movie on Komagata Maru. Just before the movie I was introduced to Ali Kazimi, the director and producer of the movie. He seemed in his 40's and made a few background remarks before the movie rolled in. It took him eight years and he spent 50% of his own money. The main financial support came from the South Asian Heritage Foundation of Canada. </p>
<p>For a moment, I really wondered at a Muslim making a movie like this. Then Sir Richard Attenborough, the director and producer of the classic movie, <strong><em>Gandhi </em></strong><em></em>came up. Also, in the same breath crossed the name of Rahi Masoom Raza who wrote the stirring dialogues of the popular epic TV serial Mahabharata. <strong>In the world of men, you can not sweep the entire race on any belief. </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>After the movie, I told Kazimi, “The movie is powerful, the background music great, and your baritone voice narrating most of the events perfect”. The famous Bollywood actor Naseeruddin Shah also lent his voice. My voice has the least commercial value! Above all, the archival research undertaken was also a labor of love. You can not cut corners. </p>
<p><strong>Freedom after Indentured labor </strong></p>
<p>Punjabis were brought as indentured labor in Canada since 1880's. The cold climate required robust labor force of Punjab . The news of 1890 gold rush in northern Nevada and northern California attracted some Sikhs to cross the border into the US states of Washington , Oregon and California . The hard working Punjabis were pushed out of the mining areas of which they had little knowledge, but the farming regions of Fresno and Imperial Valley attracted them to settle for it. Soon the word of a better quality of life in Canada and USA spread in parts of Punjab . It was a combination of economic opportunities and desire to live in freedom that triggered an early trickle of Punjabis into North America . </p>
<p><strong>Gathering Storm </strong></p>
<p>Gurdit Singh, a business entrepreneur in Hong Kong chartered the Japanese ship Komagata Maru for taking the Punjabis into Canada . This ship was built in Germany in 1898, sold to Sicily and then to Japan , and thus got its Japanese name. In Japanese, Maru means ship and Komataga is a popular name like Elizabeth in English. From the archive documents, it is evident that Gurdit Singh was fully conversant with the British immigration laws in the colonies and political ramification of his enterprise. Before sailing, he also took the legal advice from the British attorneys in Hong Kong . </p>
<p>As soon as the ship neared Vancouver harbor in British Columbia , the Canadian media went up in arms against Indians. The daily newspaper headlines were like, ” <strong>The Hindu invasion of </strong><strong>Canada </strong><strong> Imminent! </strong>”. A subsequent search of the passengers produced not even a single weapon. It was a time when the unwritten policy of the Canadian Government was Canada for the White Anglo Sextons. In 1907, the Canadian immigration policy was essentially amended to exclude Indians who flourished once the five year period of indentured labor was over. <strong>It was finally corrected in 1948 </strong>. In a near future, the Canadian Government is going to apologize to the Sikhs for this historic discrimination. </p>
<p><strong>Empire </strong><strong></strong><strong>Building </strong></p>
<p>After decimating most native Indians in Canada and corralling the rest in open prisons called Indian reservations, the Whites naturally wanted to reap all the advantages for themselves. <strong>It is a universal strategy of a victor </strong>. Whenever, the Greeks, Afghanis, Arabs, Iranians, Turks and Mughals carved out parts of India as their hegemony they had their brethren from homelands follow them into key positions particularly in military, civil administration, and law and order. After all, the white Canadians were not supposed to welcome Indians. <strong>But the crux was of legality. </strong></p>
<p>The then British Prime Minister went on record in supporting a ban on the entry of Indians in Canada by saying that the ‘Hindus have not contributed any thing to the human race in the last 2000 years. <strong>In recent times, the US TV evangelist Billy Graham and presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan have made similar statements against the Hindus </strong>. </p>
<p>It is no wonder that the Canadian federal and provincial governments, immigration authorities, and courts were all stacked up against the Indians stranded in a ship 1 KM away from the shore of Vancouver . The Shore Committee formed out of a small community of 2000 Indians in Vancouver was able to hire a white attorney, Edward. He did a good job at the risk of his own life and that of his family. Whatever legal grounds he presented, were eventually rejected by the court system. </p>
<p><strong>Komagata Maru and the Gadar Party </strong></p>
<p>About the same time the Gadar Party was formed in 1914 in San Francisco . It was not too far from Canadian waters. <strong>It requires further research as to what role did the Gadar party play during the Komagata standoff </strong>. After nearly two months when food and water ran out in Komagata Maru, the white Canadian militia under the ruse of supplying provisions clashed with the demoralized passengers. <strong>This is the first maritime revolt of Indians </strong>. A couple of Indians were killed and a few injured. The passengers being at a high point had an advantage in hurling the objects down on the boat. The militia retreated back to the coast. Some compromise was made. </p>
<p><strong>Integrating Media </strong></p>
<p>My thought went onto Gandhi Ji who assiduously used the media to his advantage in every agitation he undertook in South Africa and India . He became the darling of some western media. It was the media reporting of the British police beating the unarmed and peaceful <strong><em>Satyagrahis </em></strong> (means steadfasts on truth) that shook the conscience of the west. As compared with some Indian scenarios, Komagata was a very big stage. <strong>But there was no media reporting on behalf of the Indians. </strong>Thus Komataga saga lies buried and nearly forgotten in history. </p>
<p><strong>Hindu Individualism </strong></p>
<p>The Hindus including the legendary chivalry of the Rajputs have displayed individual acts of heroism. Often they lacked in leadership <strong>. Courage as trait one is born with, but leadership is institutionally cultivated. </strong> A few years ago, while talking with a liberal British professor of history, I said, ”On a one to one basis, for every smart British, there </p>
<p>was a smarter Hindu even in the 18 th century India . But the Hindus immediately lose this edge as their groups are compared. Perhaps any group of two English men was stronger than every group of two Hindus in a population of 330 millions! The British ruled India because of the divisiveness of the Hindus. If it were not the British, then French or Dutch may have taken over India .” He was speechless. </p>
<p><strong>Tolerance defines Hinduism </strong></p>
<p>In every media reporting and government communiqu&eacute;s on Komagata Maru, the word used for Indians was Hindus. Kazimi remarked that Hindustan being the name of the country during the Mughal period, so its people were called Hindus. Islam and Christianity of foreign soil had taken roots in India by the 19 th century. I rolled back to the pages of history when India was a 100% Hindu nation. Its hallmark was tolerance for other religious practices. The erstwhile Hindu kings and princes let the Jews, early Christians of St. Thomas and Parsees come, live in freedom and flourish in India . In recent history, the European trading companies and Christian missionaries established their posts and churches on the coast of India . <strong>Islam alone entered </strong><strong>India </strong><strong> with sword </strong>. </p>
<p><strong>The more I contemplate, the more I am convinced that the ideal of secularism can only become a reality under the Hindu religious states </strong>. The current practice and interpretation of secularism in India are anti-Hindus. More communal riots have erupted since 1947 partition of India than 100 years before it. This was aptly acknowledged by a Muslim leader in 1993 when the Muslims fled to Nepal after the communal riots in Mumbai. He said, “The Muslims are safer in the Hindu kingdom of Nepal than in secular India !” </p>
<p><strong>Perennial Causes </strong></p>
<p><strong>There are two main reasons for the failure of any militant course by Indians against the British </strong>. They surfaced up in Komagata Maru episode in 1914 and in the case of the <strong><em>Gadaris </em></strong> (means revolutionaries) returning in another ship from the US to India that too in 1914. One, the US and the Canadian governments openly colluded with the British in spying over the meetings and infiltrating its membership. Neither the Gadar Party in San Francisco nor the Shore Committee in Vancouver had taken measures to counter against massive espionage by the government machineries. The declassified documents show how easy it was for the Americans and Canadians to exchange information between authorities in USA/Canada, England and India . </p>
<p>The other reason is the presence of <strong><em>Jaichands </em></strong> (means proverbial traitors) amongst the Hindus. They betray by essentially thinking for themselves rather than of the nation at large. The documentary revealed how two members of the Shore Committee turned disloyal. In the ultimate analysis, this recurring historical fact boils down to religion. <strong>Hinduism giving ultimate freedom in pursuit of life and happiness, an individual is more likely to watch his own interest at the cost of his society </strong>. At the other end, Islam instills community over individual. That is why no one has betrayed Osama Bin Ladin in four years for $50 million bounty put on his head by the US Government. The <strong><em>Jehad </em></strong>works on absolute loyalty to Islam. </p>
<p><strong>Some Demographic Findings </strong></p>
<p>It is pertinent to examine some demographic data on 376 Indian passengers in Komagata Maru. The website: http://people.lib.ucdavis.edu/tss/punjab/districtlist.html, the most comprehensive and reliable source of material on the Gadar Party and Komagata Maru and Punjabi issues is professionally maintained by Tejinder Singh Sibia of UC Davis. The list has 372 passengers. Perhaps, four kids were not included. It has only three pieces of data on each person, namely, <strong>first name </strong>, <strong>district </strong> and <strong>village </strong>. That interestingly shows that the village identity becoming extinct today was stronger 100 years ago than of the last name. At least, 95% Indians lived in the villages at that time vs. 75 % today. </p>
<p>All the 372 passengers were from Punjab . The united Punjab before the 1947 partition of India had 19 districts. Some districts were at least twice the size of present districts in India . Six of them are now in Pakistan . Ambala and Hissar are parts of a new state of Haryana carved out of Punjab in 1965. The maximum number of 74 Punjabis came from Ferozepur District. Four districts had only one person each. It included Faridkot District that covered my home town Bathinda! </p>
<p>From the names, 20 are clearly identified as Muslims; 18 of which came from one district Shahpur. It may be noted that in the late 19 th century particularly after the 1857 Indian Revolt, the Hindus and Muslims had come very close as they fought against the British. Many Hindus had names like Ram Bakhash, Iqbal, Ram Deen etc. This list contains 4-5 such names. </p>
<p><strong>Hindu and Sikh Identity </strong></p>
<p>However, it is very difficult to differentiate between the Hindus and Sikhs from their first names. As a matter of fact, in popular parlance the Hindus in Punjab are still referred as <strong><em>MONAY </em></strong> (means clean shaven) and Sikhs as <strong><em>KESDHARI </em></strong> (means retaining hair). Nearly 100 % of the first few generations of <strong><em>KHALSA </em></strong> (baptized/ <strong><em>Amaratdhari </em></strong> Sikhs) came out of the Hindus. </p>
<p>After the Sikh holocaust in the first half of the 18 th century their depleted population was only replenished by mass adoption of Sikhism by the Hindus. The adults of 1914 era were born in late 19 th century at a time when the Sikh population was boosted by the eldest males in Hindu families baptized as Sikh. This practice still continues in many <strong><em>KHATRI </em></strong> families like Bhatias, Kapurs, Walias, Malhotras of Punjab that have members both Hindus and Sikhs. Certainly, the pre and post 1984 Amritsar tragedy has damaged the communal ties. <strong>That is one of the main reasons of the reported decline of the Sikh population in </strong><strong>Punjab </strong><strong> during the last five years </strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Names and Headwears </strong></p>
<p>Singh is not exclusively used by the Sikhs in India . In the districts of Amritsar and Gurdaspur some <strong><em>Brahmins </em></strong> use Singh after their first name. In Bathinda District, I have personally known some <strong><em>Banias </em></strong> using Singh too. There are many local legends behind such practices. <em>Pag/Pagari </em> was a common headwear of males in north India having numerous styles and designs. The Hindus by and large used to stop wearing a <em>Pagari </em> after joining the service of the British Raj. </p>
<p><strong>How Many Hindus? </strong></p>
<p>The Hindus numbering 12 as mentioned in an article has no bases. In the list, the <strong>typical Hindu names </strong> in alphabetical order with their frequencies in parentheses are as follows: Arjan (7), Bhagwan (3), Bishan (5), Chanan (7), Indar (11), Kishan (6), Lal (4), Nand (5), Narayan (6), Partap (4), Ram (5), Sundar (11) &gt;From a large group picture of the passengers standing on the ship deck one can see out of 19 persons there are only seven Sikhs. It is difficult to conclude that this sample statistically represents all 372 passengers. Nevertheless, putting the entire analysis together, I would claim that at least 100 passengers were Hindus. </p>
<p>Let it be made clear that the passengers were not illiterate villagers. Some were city dwellers with no village connections. <strong>Clearly identified </strong> are one physician with his wife (Dr. and Mrs. Raghunath) and two other women Kishan Kaur and Prabha. The name Chanda is unisex. </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Komagata Maru in Indian Waters </strong></p>
<p>Instead of returning to the originating port of Hong Kong , the British colonial authorities forced Komagata Maru to sail towards <strong>India </strong><strong>. </strong>In order to contain the repercussions of possible violence, the ship was directed to Budge Budge situated at the mouth of Hoogly River . It was a few miles away from <strong>Calcutta </strong><strong>, the capital of </strong><strong>British India </strong><strong> till 1912 </strong>. </p>
<p>This conspiracy further aggravated the passengers suffering from every physical deprivation for over three months. <strong>Consequently, there was a second and more violent revolt at the sea </strong>. The authorities being better equipped and positioned controlled them this time. Nearly forty passengers died or reported missing. Some were arrested, a few hanged and most put behind the bars. The Komagata Maru was heavily damaged and went out of service for a while. </p>
<p>The two local Canadian leaders Bhag Singh and Balwant Singh were hanged for trumped up charges of treason, though Balwant Sigh had served the British Army with distinction. He was a Gurudwara priest in Vancouver . The trailblazer Gurdit Singh's life was transformed once he came in contact with Gandhi Ji. He also served five years in prison, but lived long enough to see India free. He died on July 04, 1954 , at age 94. </p>
