  High Court issues notice to Centre, 2 states</FONT></B><BR>
  <BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entertaining a public interest litigation files by 
  a Chandigarh resident to "redeem Ghadarites pride", the Punjab and Haryana High 
  Court has issued notice of motion to the Government of India through the Ministry 
  of Home Affairs and Punjab and Haryana governments through their respective 
  chief secretaries for September 17, 2001.<BR>
  <BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the petition filed by Mr. Malwinder Jit 
  Singh Waraich, a Chandigarh based researched on the Ghadar movement who appeared 
  in person, the notice of motion was issued by a divisional branch of justice 
  Mr. R S Mongia and justice Mr. K C Gupta on its hearing held on April 24, last. 
  <BR>
  <BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the basis of his research and quoting certain historical 
  facts Mr. Waraich in his petition has sought directions from the court to the 
  Ministry of Home Affairs (GoI) to recognize the Ghadar Movement (1914-1915), 
  which the petitioner alleged was not included in the list of movements and mutinies 
  recognized by central government besides seeking the orders from the court to 
  the Punjab government to extend the benefits to all the collateral heirs of 
  the Ghadarites as it had already done to the cousin sister of martyr Kartar 
  Singh Sarabha, Mata Jagdish Kaur to whom it recently accorded the status of 
  "mother of Punjab".<BR>
  <BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been pointed out that the state government, 
  in a reply to a question on the same issue by comrade Hardev Harshi, a CPI MLA 
  had categorically replied in the recent Assembly session (March 27, 2001) that 
  "only unmarried daughters of Ghadarites were eligible for the benefits under 
  the pension scheme." <BR>
  <BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Challenging the same reply of the state government 
  through its minister for the welfare of freedom fighters and jails the petitioner 
  has categorically accused the Punjab government of "misleading" the house and 
  observed that "it ill behoves the Punjab government to practice arbitrariness 
  in the matters of noble souls of the motherland in recognition of their supreme 
  sacrifices." <BR>
  <BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stating that the "ill conceived" and "unjust" response 
  of the state government towards the martyrs is "incompatible" with any standards 
  of governance, Mr. Waraich pleaded before the court that in the interests of 
  justice the government should grant pension benefits to all collateral heirs 
  of Ghadarites. <BR>
  <BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintaining that the "omission" of the Ghadar movement 
  from the list, which entitles the dependents and the family members of Ghadarites 
  to the freedom fighter's pension benefits, must be "rectified" the petitioner 
  alleged that to exclude a movement in which 46 Ghadarites were hanged, 69 imprisoned 
  for life and transported to Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 145 awarded lesser 
  sentences and properties of most of these revolutionaries confiscated after 
  the movement, is a gross violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, 
  besides being against the "principles of natural justice morality, good conscience."<BR>
  <BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pleading that since most of the kin of the Ghadarites 
  do not have any documentary proof of their ancestors participation in the freedom 
  struggle, but being active in research on the same for past 30 years in which 
  he has collected authentic material, Mr. Waraich prayed that he should be attached 
  with the identification process of the kins of Ghadarites. <BR>
