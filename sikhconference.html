<P></P><B><I>Report on the International Conference on the Sikh Diaspora, April 
21-22, 2001, University of California, Santa Barbara</I></B> 
<P><B><I>[Report written by Shinder S Thandi, Visiting Professor in Global 
Studies, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA]</I></B> 
<P></P>The Sikh community, now numbering around 20 million, is scattered across 
the globe. Whilst the majority of Sikhs still reside in the Punjab there has an 
outward migration to most areas of the world over the past 500 years. Sikh 
settlements outside Punjab started in the sixteenth century and accelerated 
during the second half of the nineteenth century after the annexation of Punjab 
in 1849 and increased army recruitment of the Sikhs to the British Indian army. 
By the closing decades of the nineteenth century Sikhs had started migrating in 
significant numbers to as far away places as Fiji, New Zealand, Australia and to 
the southeast Asian countries of Singapore and Malaysia. By the beginning of 
this century, they had started arriving on the Pacific coast of North America 
until the Immigration laws and the Komagatu maru affair curtailed their further 
migration. There was also a sizable movement of Sikhs to east Africa, recruited 
to help develop the railway and road infrastructure. Later, as immigration laws 
were relaxed and as demand for labour increased during the post-war boom 
periods, Sikhs began to settle in large numbers in Europe and North America. 
<P></P>Despite this presence of Sikhs communities in foreign lands for well over 
a century, no serious attempt has been made to trace their evolution and 
development outside Punjab and India. Further, there is little documented 
knowledge about their struggles and achievements and the challenges they faced 
in transmitting their heritage, tradition and group consciousness to the younger 
generations in environments that were usually very hostile. It was because of 
these apparent gaps in the historiography of overseas based Sikhs that scholars 
associated with the Sikh Studies program at the University of California, Santa 
Barbara (UCSB), decided to dedicate their second international conference on 
Sikh Studies to the theme of the Sikh Diaspora. 
<P></P><B><I>Professor Gurinder Singh Mann</I></B> 
<P></P>The conference was organized by Professor Gurinder Singh Mann who holds 
the Kundan Kaur Kapany Chair in Sikh Studies at UCSB. Professor Mann has been 
the driving force behind raising the profile of Sikh Studies in North America 
over the past ten years and has been instrumental in nurturing a critical mass 
of young scholars who, he hopes, will carry the beacon forward for the benefit 
of future generations. The funding for the conference was provided by the 
proceeds from the Kudan Kaur Kapany Chair in Sikh Studies and the program in 
Global and International Studies, University of California, Santa Barbara. 
<P></P><B><I>Professor Mark Juergensmeyer</I></B> 
<P></P>The two-day conference theme was divided into two distinct themes. The 
first day focussed on the histories of the Sikh diaspora whereas the second 
looked at the cultural representations in the Sikh diaspora. Professor Mark 
Juergensmeyer, Director of the Global and International Studies programme at 
UCSB, an early pioneer in the promotion of Sikh Studies in North America and 
proactive in the establishment of the Chair at Santa Barbara, opened the 
conference, welcomed the delegates and shared a personal narrative of the events 
that first eroused his interest in Sikh/Punjab studies when he was a young 
graduate student at Berkeley. He recalled how he was presented with a totally 
unexpected but a fortunate opportunity to examine and document discarded records 
of the Ghadrite movement. This experience was enough for him to pursue some of 
the issues further especially as they related to the Indian nationalist 
discourse and the religious and social movements in the Punjab. 
<P></P><B><I>Professor Mann</I></B> 
<P></P>Professor Mann, in his introductory remarks in welcoming delegates, 
reminded them to focus on a century of migration, the long period of suffering 
and struggles, but more importantly, on the achievements of the Sikh community. 
He emphasized that it was time to move away from formulations that led to 
perceptions of the diaspora Sikhs as victims or marginalised exiles as the 
community had now matured to a stage where the diasporic experience needed to be 
celebrated. He gave a number of examples of countries across the globe where 
Sikhs held very responsible positions and were in playing an influential role in 
decision-making in their adopted homes. 
<P></P><B><I>Professor J.S. Grewel</I></B> 
<P></P>The first morning session, chaired by the distinguished scholar, Ainslee 
T Embree, of Columbia University, started with a paper by the eminent historian 
of Sikh history, Professor J. S. Grewal, former Vice Chancellor of Guru Nanak 
Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab. Professor Grewal made an original attempt to 
explain the emergence of Sikhs communities in the different parts of the Mughal 
Punjab and other regions of India from about 1500 to 1850. The developmet of 
these communities were closely associated with the travels of the Gurus and 
their disciples. By careful reading of the Janamsakhis and other rare documents 
such as the Dabistan and early Hukumnamas, he explained the spread of Sikhs, 
especially as traders, as far away as Dacca to the east and to the NorthWest 
Frontier to the west. By the close of the nineteenth century Sikh communities 
had been established in large numbers in Kolkata, Hydrabad, Sind and the Bombay 
Provinces. 
<P></P><B><I>Professor Indu Banga</I></B> 
<P></P>The second paper was presented by Professor Indu Banga, an established 
historian based at Punjab University, Chandigarh. Her paper covered the crucial 
period 1850 to 1950 during which we see large-scale movement of Sikhs outside 
the Punjab. In a meticulously detailed paper she peroidized Sikh migration into 
three main geographical locations: the early South Pacific phase, the second 
North American phase and the more recent post-war European and North American 
phase. Although she emphasized the importance of both the push and pull 
pressures generating both internal and overseas migration, her focus was mainly 
on the former. She explained how changing agrarian fortunes, land rights 
legislation, British colonial labour policy including army recruitment, were 
important determinants. She also gave specific reasons why Sikh overseas 
migration was particularly concentrated in the doaba region of Punjab. 
<P></P><B><I>Professor Hew McLeod</I></B> 
<P></P>The morning session also included case studies of pioneer Sikhs in 
Australia and New Zealand and a profile of the contemporary Sikh community in 
the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan. Professor Hew McLeod, a highly 
respected historian of the Sikh tradition, traced the evolution of the Sikh 
communities in Australia and New Zealand from the 1880s onwards until ,migration 
was restricted through legislation in the early 1920s. His main focus was on the 
New Zealand community, which he had researched over a long period. He described 
the main forms of their economic activities, especially their involvement in 
agricultural and dairy farming and their early attempts at institution building. 
Professor McLeod paid particular attention to the existence of differential 
relations of the Sikhs with the Pukihar (New Zealanders of European decent) and 
indigenous Maori communities. 
<P></P><B><I>Gurdit Singh</I></B> 
<P></P>Gurdit Singh, a young doctoral scholar based in Sociology at UCSB, made a 
visual presentation on the minority Sikh community in the North West Frontier 
Province. Through his slides he traced the evolution of the community, their 
geographical concentration and socio-economic well-being. He particularly 
emphasized the challenges facing the community in maintaining and transmitting 
Sikh tradition within a dominant Islamic culture. 
<P></P><B><I>Professor Shinder S. Thandi</I></B> 
<P></P>The afternoon session, chaired by Professor John S. Hawley of Columbia 
University, included four papers on Europe and North America where an 
overwhelming majority of the Sikhs outside India resides. Shinder S Thandi, 
founder Editor of the International Journal of Punjab Studies and currently a 
Visiting Professor in Global and International Studies at UCSB, provided an 
overview of the settlement, struggles and achievements of the Sikh community in 
Europe. Focussing mainly on the Sikh experience in Britain (where the community 
numbers around 400,000) he particularly emphasized the protracted struggles of 
Sikhs during the 1960s and 1970s to gain economic, cultural and social space. By 
the 1990s however, the Sikhs community had developed confidence and maturity, 
was becoming more visible in the civic, political, social and economic life of 
Britain and was now able to assert and celebrate their cultural identity. 
<P></P><B><I>Professor Hugh Johnston</I></B> 
<P></P>Professor Hugh Johnston, a well known historian of Sikh history from 
Simon Fraser University, Canada, focussed on the pioneer Canadian Sikhs, their 
struggles in building institutions and overcoming hostile and racist sentiments, 
especially harsh immigration controls in the earlier part of this century. He 
recalled the Komagatu maru incident and the important role this has played in 
the psychie of Canadian Sikhs since then. 
<P></P><B><I>Professor Jane Singh</I></B> 
<P></P>Professor Jane Singh of University of California, Berkeley, continued 
this theme of struggle when she provided a lucid and detailed account of the 
early Sikh pioneers in California, USA, in the first two decades of this 
century. Professor Singh, who has previously undertaken path-breaking research 
on the Ghadrites, emphasized three main areas for special consideration: the 
early settlement period and material conditions of pioneer Sikhs; role of US 
public policy and how this hampered activities of minorities like the Sikhs; and 
the emergence of a strong sense of ethnic consciousness. 
<P></P><B><I>Professor Constance M. Elsberg</I></B> 
<P></P>The fourth and final paper of the afternoon session was presented by 
Profesor Constance M. Elsberg, a sociologist from North Virginia College, 
Virginia. Her focus was on non-Punjabi Sikhs (gora Sikhs) in the West with a 
particular focus on the 3HO movement. Professor Elsberg traced the history of 
the Happy, Holy, Healthy organization (3HO) to the new religious 
(counter-culture) movements that began in the 1960s and 1970s on university 
campuses across America. By the late 1960s Harbhajan Singh Yogi had entered the 
stage and the movement began to take on a distinct Sikh tradition orientation 
focussing on aspects of tantric yoga. Although the community of followers grew 
quickly, by the late 1990s it appeared to be running out of steam both due to 
internal organizational problems and difficulties in sustaining the movements 
popularity with the offspring of the earlier members. 
<P></P><B><I>Dr. Bhagan Singh</I></B> 
<P></P>The second day of the conference was devoted to examining the cultural 
representations in the Sikh diaspora. The morning session, chaired by Professor 
Thomas R. Metcalf of the University of California, Berkeley, included five 
papers, which focused on aspects of education, art and music in the diaspora. 
The first paper was presented by Dr. Bhajan Singh, an educational practitioner 
from Singapore. In a hugely applauded multi-media presentation, Bhajan Singh 
talked about meeting challenges of cultural transmission among the Thai and 
Singapore Sikh youth. He explained the philosophy behind their Sikh education 
model, the careful selection and production of course materials and their 
delivery. Their model had proved to be a success with 2,000 children currently 
going through the education programme in Singapore alone. The model was now also 
successfully being delivered in the two other countries with major Sikh 
settlement in the region: Thailand and Malaysia. 
<P></P><B><I>Suzanne McMahon</I></B> 
<P></P>The next speaker, Suzanne McMahon, South Asian Librarian at the 
University of California, Berkeley, provided details of her involvement in 
developing archival material (including the infamous Ghadar collection) which is 
now available to researchers on the Sikh and South Asian diaspora both at 
Berkeley and other University of California libraries. She explained that a lot 
of financial resources had been committed to collecting and preserving valuable 
records of individuals, of family and of localized histories of the earlier 
migrants. A large part of these resources were now available in digital form. 
She also provided details of the forthcoming exhibition she was helping to 
organize on early pioneers entitled Echoes of Freedom. 
<P></P><B><I>Susan Stronge</I></B> 
<P></P>The third paper was presented by Susan Stronge, Curator of South Asian 
Art at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Susan Stronge had been 
instrumental in organizing the hugely successful exhibition on The Arts of the 
Sikh Kingdoms at the V&amp;A in 1999. She had also edited the accompanying book 
to the exhibition which gave more detailed information on the items in the 
exhibition, their significance and their current condition and location. In her 
presentation, she discussed the difficulties in gathering the material, the 
selection and omission of artifacts to exhibit and the cultural and educational 
programme which complimented the exhibition. 
<P></P><B><I>Amrita &amp; Rabindra Kaur Singh</I></B> 
<P></P>The fourth paper of the morning session was delivered by the Sikh artist 
twins Amrita and Rabindra Kaur Singh from the UK entitled Twin Dialogue: Our 
Art. Born and educated in Merseyside in northern England, the twins first became 
interested in their own heritage after a visit to Punjab in 1980. At University 
they decided to develop their own distinct style, first imitating the Mughal 
miniature paintings and then borrowing on styles depicted within the Sikh 
tradition. They explained that a crucial factor in their decision to concentrate 
on their own heritage reflected very much a rebellion against the pressure that 
white teachers had exerted on them to develop a European style. Thus their 
approach was to directly confront the euro-centricism inherent in the British 
art curriculum. Through a slide show of some of their paintings, they 
demonstrated the development of their own unique style, which reflected their 
own personal experiences of growing up in Britain as young British Sikhs. 
<P></P><B><I>Gibb Schreffler</I></B> 
<P></P>The final paper of the morning was delivered by Gibb Schreffler, a 
doctoral student working on Bhangra music in the Department of Music at UCSB. In 
a paper entitled British Bhangra Music in the 1980s, Schreffler traced the 
history of early Bhangra groups like Alaap and Premi and the changing musical 
forms and their deviation from traditional Punjabi music. He argued, using 
pictures and sound recordings, that the 1980s Bhangra music had a very distinct 
Britishness about it and it was more geared for disco dancing than drawing from 
the traditional Punjab folk dance. The boy bands proliferated in the 1980s but 
later also began to fragment and then to lose appeal towards the end of the 
decade. British Bhangra had to be re-invented in the early 1990s. 
<P></P><B><I>Amarjit Chandan</I></B> 
<P></P>The afternoon session was chaired by Profesor Nirvikar Singh, from the 
Economics department, University of California, Santa Cruz. This final session 
included three papers on Punjabi Literature in the diaspora. Amarjit Chandan 
from London, author of several books of Punjabi poetry, read his paper on the 
state of Punjabi literature in England. He argues that Punjabi literature 
flourished upto the 1980s but since then there has seen a slow decline. This, he 
argued was related both to the declining use of Punjabi language by new writers 
and because of lower levels of literacy and proficiency in Punjabi language 
amongst the second-generation migrants. He finished his session with a 
recitation of several of his poems in Punjabi that emotionally moved the 
audience. 
<P></P><B><I>Sadhu Binning</I></B> 
<P></P>Sadhu Binning, of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada 
presented the second paper. In contrast to the pessimistic scenario of the 
British case presented by Amarjit Chandan, Binning described the Punjabi 
Canadian literary scene as flourishing and vibrant. He disclosed that there were 
now about 150 writers in Canada publishing literature and poetry in Punjabi and 
this has resulted in an output of around 125 books since the 1960s. However, 
Binning painted a very grim picture of the status of Punjabi literature both 
within the Sikh community and mainstream literary circles. In the former, there 
was a distinct lack of interest in reading this literature and in the case of 
the latter, there was no acknowledgement or recognition of this literature 
despite the fact that most of the literature was very much focussed on the 
Canadian social condition. 
<P></P><B><I>Ajmer Rode</I></B> 
<P></P>Ajmer Rode, award-winning author of eleven book of Punjabi poetry, was 
the final speaker. He is also based in Vancouver, Canada. Rode repeated many of 
the concerns of Binning especially relating to the perceptions of inferior 
status of Punjabi literature. He pointed out that it was indeed a paradoxical 
situation where the universities in Punjab had recognized their literature by 
including their books in the Punjabi literature curriculum, the Sikh and the 
mainstream community in Canada had failed to recognize this literary 
contribution. By popular request both the latter speakers also recited some of 
their Punjabi poetry. 
<P></P>This conference was a very rewarding and enriching experience. By 
focusing on histories of the diaspora on the first day and recalling the lived 
experiences of the diaspora in the second, the conference organizers had 
provided the audience with plenty of food for thought. The conference not only 
highlighted the commonalties in early migratory experiences but also provided 
interesting insights into comparative experiences of Sikh diaspora communities. 
Over the two days, the conference demonstrated the strengths of the Sikh 
community to pull together in conditions of adversity, to excel in conditions 
where equal opportunities are guaranteed, to nurture and transmit cultural 
heritage against overwhelming pressures and to celebrate success with vigor and 
candor which remains the envy of other Indian diaspora communites. The 
organizers must be congratulated on the success of the conference and urged to 
make such conferences more frequent events.
