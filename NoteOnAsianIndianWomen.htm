    <p class="style6">Asian Indians in British Columbia are relatively recent immigrants. The earliest recorded history of their presence dates their arrival around the mid-1800s when merchants, sailors, and mercantilists briefly sojourned. 1 As time passed, retired Sikh soldiers came to view the reported beauty and vastness of the British Empire's newly settled colony as they traveled en route to India after having attended Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. These travelers sent inviting reports on Canada and its prospective wealth to their friends and relatives. Around the same time, some steamship companies, particularly the CPR, stirred up interest in emigration to Canada among the people of the Punjab. According to Johnston, the Sikhs in 1904 were "encouraged by Hong Kong agents of the Canadian Pacific Railway who were seeking to replace steerage traffic lost after the Canadian government had raised the head tax on Chinese immigrants." 2 Slowly, and sometimes in small groups, men who were assumed to be "Hindu," arrived in British Columbia. 3 No women came. </p>
