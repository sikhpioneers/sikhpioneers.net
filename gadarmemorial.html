</h3>
<p>The Hindustan Gadar Party, when founded in 1913 to join in the struggle for 
  India's independence, started its operation from 436 Hill Street, San Francisco. 
  Its original home was known as &quot;Yugantar Ashram&quot; and it was from here 
  that the freedom fighters of the Hindustan Gadar Party, also known as &quot;Gadri 
  Babas&quot; were active from 1913 to 1917. It was from this place that they 
  would organize and launch a revolution and publish a powerful weekly paper called 
  &quot;Gadar&quot; to propagate the cause of Indian independence. The Party's 
  Headquarters subsequently moved to &quot;5 Wood Street&quot;, the present location. 
  The activities of the Gadar Party were so intense, its popularity instantaneous; 
  the edifice soon came to be called &quot;Gadar Ashram&quot;. The three-storied 
  building that preceded the present the present structure served several functions. 
  Imbued with the spirit of revolution, it provided an environment for thinkers, 
  activists and volunteers who came to live, work, organize, and help run a printing 
  press that sent their messages around the world. It remained their venue for 
  all-important public and secret meetings. So powerful was its influence that 
  in August 1914, when the Party called on overseas Indians to return to India 
  to fight for its freedom, most living in North America heeded the call and no 
  fewer than 8,000 of them were said to have returned to India to take part of 
  the revolution. Because of the strong British vigilance, most of them were captured 
  en route or upon return, many of them sent to jail, some killed or hanged. But 
  their determination, courage and sacrifice inspired thousands others to join 
  in and continued to carry out their mission. The Gadar Building is now the living 
  symbol of the glorious sacrifices of martyrs of the freedom and those who struggled 
  for India's freedom.<br>
  <br>
  After India won its freedom, the Ashram along with its belongings including 
  some historical records etc. was handed over in 1949 to the Government of India 
  through our Consulate. However, de jure transfer was effected in June 1952. 
  The building, at that stage, was about 30 years old and it was very much in 
  a dilapidated condition. Efforts were made from 1952 onwards to set up a suitable 
  memorial, by the local Indian community and the Government of India, the latter 
  sanctioning $83,000 U.S for the restoration work. The groundbreaking ceremony 
  for the restoration of the Building was performed by Sardar Swaran Singh, the 
  then Minister of External Affairs in September 1974. The Gadar Memorial was 
  finally inaugurated by Shri T.N.Kaul, at the time India's to U.S in March 1975.</p>
<p>Gadar Memorial Library was inaugurated by Shri Y.B. Chavan, the then Minister 
  of External Affairs in October 1976, making the donation of books by the Indian 
  council for Cultural Relation. The library has a collection of Hindi and English 
  books on various subjects.</p>
<p>Apart from celebrating national festivals like Independence Day and Republic 
  Day, from time to time, the Consulate General also organizes other official 
  functions at the Gadar Memorial Hall.<br>
