<P> <strong>Quoted from the University of Santa Cruz, Division of Graduate Studies <br>
    <br>
    <em>2004-05 Guru Gobind Singh Fellowship Competition <br>
    <br>
    </em></strong>In 1998 the University received a bequest from the late Mr. Karam Singh Maughan to establish an endowment to support graduate fellowships (named for Guru Gobind Singh, the Sikh religious leader) to be awarded to <strong>graduates of universities in a specific area of India and Pakistan for the purpose of pursuing graduate study at the University of California </strong>. Formerly administered by the Office of the President, this endowment has been reallocated to the Santa Cruz campus, and [Vice Provost and Dean Frank Talamantes] is writing to invite our campus nomination for the 2004-05 award. <br>
    <br>
To be eligible, a student must be (1) be a graduate of an Indian or Pakistani university [please request copy of the map from Deborah McCook at the UC Davis Grad Studies Office for the specified area], (2) be committed to returning to her or his country of origin after receiving the degree, and (3) <em>not </em>have engaged previously in graduate study at any other institution of higher learning in the United States. Mr. Maughan also specified that individuals already holding the master? degree will have preference. <br>
<br>
Students at any stage of graduate study may be nominated, provided that the nominating campus will commit to providing a Nonresident Tuition Fellowship <strong>* </strong>(or Tuition Remission) for the Singh Fellow, as needed, for the duration of the Fellow? program (assuming continued satisfactory academic progress) commencing with the year following the Singh award year. Other things being equal, however, preference to students who have reached the dissertation stage, and especially to those who have exhausted the normal sources of financial support. <br>
<br>
For 2004-05, the amount of the Singh Fellowship award will be $26,000. The award will be made based on the strength of the student? academic record and supporting documents; these should include letters of reference (one from the student? faculty sponsor), university transcripts, and nay other documents that may serve to support the candidacy. <br>
<br>
Please submit your nomination [TO THE OFFICE OF GRADUATE STUDIES AT UC DAVIS BY April 26, 2004]. Final candidate will be forwarded to Santa Cruz's Vice Provost Talamantes will review all information received, solicit such independent faculty opinion [if necessary], and announce [his] selection in late May. <br>
<br>
<strong>* UC Davis Graduate Program must be willing to pay the non-resident tuition if their student is nominated and awarded. <br>
