<b>&quot;THE GHADAR SYNDROME: NATIONALISM IN AN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY&quot;<br>
by Mark Juergensmeyer</b><br>
<p>Nationalist pride-which sharpened into the militant potency of Ghadar and its 
  futile revolution.<br>
  Notes and references:<br>
  1. The Ghadar movement was a loosely-knit organization of expatriate Punjabis 
  in North America, with headquarters in San Francisco, which printed revolutionary 
  literature against British rule in India, and attempted to send arms and guerilla 
  soldiers into India for an abortive revolutionary uprising planned for 1915. 
  The movement underwent a revival in the 1920's, with cadres of Punjabis active 
  in various Asian and European countries, in addition to San Francisco. There 
  are relatively few scholarly accounts of the Ghadar party written in the United 
  States, but a number of works are available in India, including these recent 
  studies: A.C. Bose: Indian Revolutionaries Abroad, Bharati Bhawan, Patna, 1971;

  Delhi, 1969; L.P. Mathur: Indian Revolutionary Movement in the United States

  Science, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, 1975. An overview of the literature 
  is given in Mark Juergensmeyer, &quot;The International Heritage of the Ghadar 
  Party: A Survey of the Sources,&quot; in the American journal, Sikh Sansar,

  &quot;India's Berkeley Radial,&quot; in the Sunday edition of Times of India,

  5. The cry, ferenghi maro (&quot;destroy the foreigner&quot;) frequently appeared 
  in Ghadar literature.<br>

  7. The Alienation of Land Act allowed the traditional agricultural castes, such 
  as Jats, to retain rights to the land, while disallowing such rights to urban 
  Khatri, Arora and other merchant castes. Lower castes and Untachables were also 
  excluded, since it was feared that they would be used as a front for upper castes 
  to purchase land. The adverse effect Act was to stabilize caste mobility, and 
  to strengthen the division of society along caste lines. See N. G. Barrier: 
  The Punjab Alienation of Land Bill 1900, Duke University South Asia Series, 
  Durham 1965.</p>
<p>8. The economic and social effect of these disasters, and the continuing problem 
  of moneylenders, described in Sir Malcolm Darling: The Punjab Peasant in Prosperity 
  and Debt, Oxford University Press, London, 1925. A useful summary of the conditions 
  in the Punjab around the turn of the century may be found in chapter 10, &quot;Rural 
  Indebtedness and Peasant Agitation&quot; of Khushwant Singh's History of the 
  Sikhs, Vol II, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1966.</p>
<p>9. The official statistics of the Canadian government show that over 5,000 
  immigrants from India entered Canada between 1905 and 1908 (2,124 and 2,623, 
  respectively) (cited in R. K. Das, Hindustani Workers on the Pacific Coast, 
  Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, 1923). Official records in the United States indicate 
  a similar number of immigrants was probably quite a bit greater, allowing for 
  illegal entries. Once scholar has simply doubled the official figures for her 
  own working estimate (Joan M. Jensen, &quot;Federal Policy in the Shaping of 
  Indian Occupation in the United States, 1900-1917&quot;, paper delivered at 
  the Western Conference of the Association for Asian Studies, Tempe, Arizona, 
  1974.</p>
<p>10. Some of the immigrants who worked in the British Columbia lumber mills 
  had had previous acquaintance with the lumber industry in India, in their home 
  area of Hoshiarpur, a Punjab district with abundant forest lands.</p>
<p>11. Estimates are as high as 75% of the immigrant males having served in the 
  army. Conditions of economic and social unrest in the Punjab which encourages 
  immigration also encouraged participation in the army; so it is not surprising 
  that a high number persons would seek both options of opportunity, in sequence.</p>
<p>12. These indications of the immigrants' initial prosperity came from old interviews, 
  cited in Harish Puri, &quot;The Ghadar Party: A Study in Militant Nationalism,&quot; 
  Ph.D. dissertation in Political Science, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, 
  1975, p. 39.</p>
<p>13. These, and other incidents, are summarized in R. K. Dass: op. cit., and 
  A. C. Bose; Indian Revolutionaries Abroad, Bharati Bhawan, Patna, 1971.</p>
<p>14. Harish Puri has raised an interesting argument regarding the motivation 
  for Canadian exclusion against the Punjabis. According to Puri (op. cit., pp. 
  50-51), the Punjabis were excluded among other reasons, because their residency 
  in Canada would be used for anti-British purposes. Puri marshals two pieces 
  of evidence indicating this fear among the British: a statement Colonel Swayne, 
  seriously discussed by the British India office, which claimed that &quot;dissatisfaction 
  at unfair treatment of Indians in Vancouver is certain to be exploited for the 
  purpose of harshly than Japanese and Chinese. Puri may be correct; but the fact 
  of racial an economic prejudice against the immigrant community made the exclusionary 
  restrictions possible.</p>
<p>15. A series of newspapers began to be published of newspapers began to be 
  published in British Columbia about this time, 1907-1909, with names such as 
  Free Hindustan, Aryan, and Swadesh Sewak; microfilmed copies of some of the 
  issues are on file at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. The dominant 
  themes of the newspaper are nationalist and anti-British, but some articles 
  reflect the local concerns of the immigrant community, especially regarding 
  immigration laws and economic problems.</p>
<p>16. Tarak Nath Das came to the United states in 1906 as a student a the University 
  of California, Berkeley, but soon went to Canada to agitate for nationalist 
  causes among the immigrant community in British Columbia before returning to 
  the United States via Washington and Oregon, where he continued to be involved 
  in nationalist organization. Tarak Nath Das survived the difficulties that the 
  Ghadar party later encountered, and later in his life became a distinguished 
  professor of Indian Philosophy at Columbia University, New York.</p>
<p>17. There is still a Gurudwa in Stockton, although most of the Punjabi immigrants 
  have shifted further north in the San Joaquin valley of California, where they 
  have recently erected a handsome new Gurudwara near the city of Marysville.</p>
<p>18. One of the immigrant farmers, Jawala Singh, had become so wealthy through 
  the production of potatoes that he was called &quot;the potato king.&quot; The 
  San Joaquin valley of California is remarkably similar in climate and demography 
  to the irrigated areas of the Punjab; so the immigrant Pujabis had a familiarity 
  with farmin techniques which gave them an advantage ove the American settlers 
  of the newly irrigated areas of the San Joaquin valley. The Pujabis' use of 
  skillful techniques, their ability to work hard and save their earnings, are 
  described in Bruce LaBrack, &quot;Occupational Specialization of California 
  Sikhs: The Interplay of Culture and Economics,&quot; a paper presented at the 
  Fifth Punjab Studies Conference, Berkeley, California, March 21-23, 1975.</p>
<p>19. The prohibition against owning land not only dampened the economic development 
  of many of their savings. Some of the money used to support the Ghadar party 
  come from the immigrant farmers who might otherwise have used it to purchase 
  land, or invent in equipment.</p>
<p>20. It is these events that begin most accounts of the Ghadar &quot;Party&quot;, 
  which restrict their time span to the years of 1913 through 1917. In one regards 
  Ghadar as a movement, in a more general way, the history would begin in 1907, 
  when the first nationalist meetings occurred, and continue at least into the 
  1930's.</p>
<p><br>
  21. Quite a few life histories of Ghadar members exist, many of them collected 
  for the composite history written by Gurcharan Singh Sainsara, op. cit., and 
  which are now on file in the Desh Bhagat Yaadgaar in Jullundur City, Punjab. 
  This is not, however, a representative sampling; but the life-histories do indicate 
  that the immigrants were motivated by the problems at home as well as the opportunities 
  abroad.</p>
<p>22. There is no Act formally entitled &quot;Asiatic Exclusion Act.&quot; The 
  U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1924 is often called the Oriental 
  (or Asiatic) Exclusion Act; but G.B. Lal is probably referring to the Alien 
  Land Law of 1913, which restricted Asian immigrants' rights to own land.</p>
<p>23. Brown, Emily; Har Dayal: Hindu Revolutionary and Rationalist, University 
  of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1975, p. 141. Ghadar and other publications of the 
  Ghadar movement which are extant or have been translated by the U.S. government 
  and introduced as evidence during the trial of U.S.A. vs. Franz Bopp (now in 
  the U.S. archives in San Bruno, California), are almost exclusively concerned 
  with nationalist and anti-British issues. The link between the concerns of the 
  immigrant community and the nationalism of the Ghadar movement is to be found 
  in the life-histories of the participants (e.g. Sohan Singh Bhakna, op. cit., 
  Sainsara, op. cit., the unpublished autobiographical account of the Ghadar movement 
  by D. Chenchiah, on file in the Desh Bhagat, Yaadgaar, Prithvi Singh Azad's 
  Kranti Path Ka Pathik, and Nand Singh Sihra's article in Modern Review, August 
  1913, &quot; Indians in Canada: A Pitiable Account of Their Hardships by One 
  Who Comes from the Place and<br>
  Knows Them&quot;)</p>
<p>24. The ship, Kamagata Maru, was chartered by a group of Punjab immigrants 
  in an attempt to circumvent a devious Canadian regulation which denied entry 
  to any immigrant who did not arrive on a vessel sailing directly form the immigrant's 
  homeland; at the time, no such ship sailed from India. The Komagata Maru was 
  not allowed to land anyways; and this incident was directly responsible for 
  new converts to the Ghadar cause, and greatly encouraged the movement. Two books 
  have recently been published: Sohan Singh Josh: The Tragedy of Komagata Maru, 
  People's Publishing House, New Delhi, 1975; and Ted Ferguson: A White Man's 
  Country: And Exercise in Canadian Prejudice, Doubleday Canada Ltd., Toronto, 
  1975. </p>
<p>25. The attempted Ghadar uprising in 1915 benefited by World War I in two ways: 
  it hoped that the British army would be so distracted by the War that they would 
  not be able to control the anticipated uprising; and, more directly, the Ghadarites 
  received support from the British enemies, the German's in the form of money, 
  advice, and some arms.</p>
<p>26. &quot;United States vs. Bhagat Singh Thind, Feb. 19. 1923&quot; in: Supreme 
  Court Reporter Vol. 43, No.10.</p>
<p>27. Officially titled &quot;The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1924,&quot; 
  the so-called &quot;Asiatic Exclusion Act&quot; applied to Chinese and Japanese, 
  as well as South Asians, and not fully repealed until the U.S. Immigration and 
  Nationality Act of 1965.</p>
<p>28. There was also an active attempt to link the Ghadar cause with America's 
  tradition of independence; pictures of Washington and Lincoln appeared in the 
  Ghadar papers, and in the 1920's new Ghadar newspaper was entitled &quot;The 
  United States of India.&quot;</p>
<p>29. The relationship between the immigrant community and the White Americans 
  might explain the disintegration of the Ghadar movement, as well as the rise 
  of it. According to Professor Bruce LaBrack of the University of the Pacific, 
  California, who has studied the immigrant community, hostility towards the immigrant 
  community helps it to band together in a nationalist identity, as we have described; 
  but as that hostility wanes, and the community is more accepted into society, 
  then more parochial identities emerge, and the relationships within the immigrant 
  community are more fissiparous. And in fact, the tensions between Jats and non-Jats, 
  and between doaba Punjabis and those from Ludhiana, Ferozepur and Amritsar.</p>
<p>30. Puri, Harish: op. cit.</p>
<p>31. See Sohan Singh Bhakna's autobiography: Jeewan Sangram, Yuvak Kendar Parkashan, 
  Jullundur, 1967.</p>
<p>32. At least one, Mangoo Ram, was from a Scheduled Caste (Chamar); he later 
  became a leader of the Ad Dharm movement on his return to Inida. Many of the 
  laborers in the fields in California were of higher castes, and would not have 
  engaged in such occupations in India.</p>
<p>33. G.B. Lal, a colleague of Har Dayal, said that, &quot;most of the members 
  of the Party did not understand Har Dayal's finer teachings, only the nationalism&quot; 
  (interview with G.B. Lal, April, 1973).</p>
<p>34. The relationship of former Ghadarites to the Punjab Communist Party is 
  described in Tilak Raj Chadha's &quot;Punjab's Red and White Communits: Scramble 
  for Funds from America,&quot; Thought, June 14, 1952. The international connections 
  are described by Gail Omvedt in &quot;Armed Struggle in India: The Ghadar Party,&quot; 
  Frontier, November 9, 1974 and November 16, 1974.</p>
<p>35. It is not fair to describe the factional disputes within the Ghadar organization 
  as Hindu versus Sikh; nonetheless, the death of Ram Chandra removed the last 
  Hindu intellectual of significance from the movement's leadership.</p>
<p>36. The Singh Sabha and the Gurudwara Reform Movement are evidences of this 
  identity consciousness.</p>
<p>37. There were, no doubt, many kind and gracious White Americans who did accept 
  the new Punjabi immigrants with generosity. Unfortunately, there were a significant 
  number of others to create a climate of uneasiness about the presence of the 
  new immigrants. The popular press wrote about &quot;The turbaned tide&quot; 
  from India; and at the very extreme was hate-literature, such as the tract, 
  The White Man, which contained articles such as the &quot;The Hindu: The Filth 
  of Asia.&quot; Even in recent years, the immigrants Punjabis in California are 
  sometimes called ragheads.&quot;</p>
<p>38. It was in South Africa, in 1893-1915, that Gandhi: Satyagraha in South 
  Africa, translated by V. G. Desai, Navajivan Trust, Ahmedabad, first published 
  in 1928.</p>
<p>39. The motivation for the murder of Ram Chandra has never been settled, but 
  the event occurred in the context of the U.S. government trial against Ghadar 
  for its complicity with the Germans (U.S. vs. Franz Bopp, et al.), which exacerbated 
  the existing factional tensions within the movement. See the interview with 
  Mrs. Chandra on file in the Ghadar collection of the South Asia Library Service, 
  University of California, Berkeley, and also Bhagwan Singh's Brief Sketch of 
  Life Lived, issued by the Department of Public Relations, Government of Punjab, 
  1948.</p>
<p>40. Dilip Singh Saund won the elections, and became the first person of Asian 
  ancestry to sit in the U.S. House of Representatives. See D.S. Saund: congressman 
  from India, E.P. Dutton &amp; Co., New York, 1960.</p>
<p>41. The most promising of new research on the immigrant community is that of 
  Professor Bruce LaBrack of Callison College, University of Pacific, Stockton. 
  LaBrack has compiled an extensive bibliography on the immigrant community. &quot;The 
  East Indian Experience in America,&quot; which is serialized in the journal 
  Sikh Sansar (Redwood City, California, 1976-77 issues). LaBrack's own anthropological 
  study of the community awaits publication. Prior to LaBrack, the most comprehensive 
  research on the community was undertaken by Professor Harold Jacoby, also of 
  the University of Pacific.</p>
<p>42. One such pamphlet was Hindustan ate Ireland, a translation of speech by 
  the President of the Irish Republic.</p>
<p>43. Interview with Mrs. Ram Chandra, Ghadar Collection, South Asia Library 
  Service, University of California, Berkeley, 1973.</p>
<p>44. One would suspect this to be the case, since the patterns of Indian immigration 
  were roughly similar to thse of other Asian communities; see Sucheng Chan, &quot;Overseas 
  Sikhs in the Context of Asian Migration,&quot; in Mark Jergensmeyer and N.G. 
  Barrier (eds.): Sikh Studies: Working Papers of the 1976 Summer Conference, 
  Berkeley Religious Studies Series, 1978.</p>

  (ed.): A History of Chinese in California: A Syllabus, Chinese Historical Society 
  of America, San Francisco, 1969, pp. 23-30.</p>
