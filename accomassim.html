<p><b> <font color="#993300">"While based on a relatively small sample of forty-two 
  families, the length of the study and the wealth of detail make this book a 
  superb introduction to Punjabi Sikh immigrant life to California. It also makes 
  clear the mutual impacts that result from the presence of Asian Americans within 
  the larger community and of their children in a multicultural, multilingual, 
  and multiracial school context. Moreover, the author's attention to general 
  patterns and educational issues beyond a narrow ethnic focus will make the book 
  useful for a variety of researchers from educational administrators and scholars 
  of comparative/international education to educational anthropologists and politicians 
  involved with academic and policy issues related to immigration and education." 
  </font></b></p>
<p><b> <font color="#993300">"Although well beyond the stated scope of the book, 
  there are enough references and statistics on differences between the Sikh and 
  Mexican-American student populations to make the reader interested in learning 
  more, particularly as what is presented indicates how potentially profitable 
  and revealing a more systematic, comparative analysis between these two groups 
  might be." </font></b></p>
<p><b> <font color="#993300">"This study reveals the unfortunate but not surprising 
  fact that the school system itself presents many barriers, often unconsciously, 
  to minority achievement. Its major contribution is to show how Sikhs, although 
  perceived as radically exotic by many of the surrounding majority, share many 
  important values and attitudes that parallel so-called American ideals, specifically 
  the value of hard work, commitment to family, independence, religious devotion, 
  and economic and academic success. That Sikh children are succeeding at a time 
  when many other Americans are asking what is wrong with the educational system 
  and reexamining assumptions about curriculum and pedagogy makes this book a 
  major contribution to the current debates which, eventually, are likely to fundamentally 
  alter the philosophy of American education." </font></b></p>

<p><b> <font color="#993300">"This book is a real contribution to the field of 
  educational anthropology. Gibson describes Punjabi Sikh immigrants in an American 
  high school, based on her two-year study....she demonstrates how Punjabi immigrant 
  students often outperform both majority and long-established minority students, 
  even though there is significant cultural conflict between home and school life, 
  little direct parental involvement, prejudice, language proficiency problems, 
  and a depressed socioeconomic status. Gibson explains how Punjabi students are 
  willing to subordinate specific cultural practices, accommodating the dominant 
  group, while maintaining their cultural identity. Punjabis "encourage their 
  children to adopt the 'good' ways of 'the Americans', according to Gibson (p.24)"
