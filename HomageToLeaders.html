  Our Correspondent </p>
<p><strong>Ludhiana, November 15 <br />
  The Shaheed Bhagat Singh Vichar Manch organised a function here today at Dr Amrit Kaur Nursing Home to pay homage to three martyrs Kartar Singh Sarabha, Vishnu Ganesh Pingle and Rahmat Ali. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The manch also made people aware of the Gadar Movement and the sacrifices made by Gadarites for India's independence. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr Ved Vatuc, former Professor Berkley University, California said in his key note address that the dreams of Gadarites had not been fulfilled till now even though India had achieved its freedom more than five decades ago. He said, “Gadarites had dreamed of a classless and casteless society which appears to be a distant dream even today. They had dreamed of equality and brotherhood, which seems far fetched concept even today. Hence their thoughts are still relavant.” </strong></p>
<p><strong>The other speaker Dr Tejinder Sibia from California, USA also said freedom fighters of Gadar Movement had fought for social, economic and political justices. But the social system had not changed. He said the only solution to the multiple challenges being faced by the Indians was to carry on the legacy of Gadar Movement and build a society on values of brotherhood and equality. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The seminar was attended by Prof Jagmohan, Prof A.K. Maleri, Dr H.S. Grewal, Mr Jaswant Zirakh, Master Bhajan Singh and Mr Gurmail Singh.&nbsp; </strong></p>
