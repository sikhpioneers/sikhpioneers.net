<p>The magnificent part played by the Ghaddar Party of California , U.S.A. , in the freedom struggle of India has a significant place not only in this country's history but also in world annals. Among the remnants of this Party is Sardar Sunder Singh Ghali who is passing the last days of his life, in a state of extreme penury and oblivion, in his village Ghall Kalan, district Ferozepur, Punjab. </p>
<p>Sardar Sunder Singh Ghali was born in this very village in 1888. When the national press in the Punjab, in 1907, raised the slogan of “Look without, O' Indians!” and urged that people to go out and see for themselves their condition, young adventurous Sunder Singh left for America. The free atmosphere of a free country awakened him to reality. In America he met famous revolutionaries, Lala Hardayal, M.A. and Pandit Ram Chandra of Peshawar and joined their band to fight for the country's liberation. </p>
<p>In 1913, when the “Yungantar Ashram” was founded in San Francisco and the paper ‘Ghaddar' cam out, he dedicated his life to this cause. During the first World War of 1914-18, when the Americans also declared war against the Germans and tried 36 Indians in 1917 for a conspiracy to overthrow the British rule in India, young Sunder Singh was among them. He was found guilty and sentenced along with his other comrades. He returned to India in 1927, after a stay of 20 years in the U.S.A. The authorities cancelled his passport and confined his movements to the limits of his village. </p>
