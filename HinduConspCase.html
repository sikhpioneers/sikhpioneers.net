  Plotters Warned Against More Activity After Release</h1>

      <p class="style2">SAN FRANCISCO, April 30 – Trial of the world-wide Hindu conspiracy case, which was punctuated with sensational exposures of German secret diplomacy and the killing of two defendants in the courtroom, ended here today with the sentencing of twenty-nine of the conspirators. Various fines and prison terms were imposed by United States District Judge William C. Van Fleet. The total of the prison terms was twenty-three and two-thirds years, and the fines $64,000. </p>
      <p class="style2">A conspiracy case was instituted in San Francisco by the United States government against the Germans and Indians who by conspiring had committed offences against the neutrality of the United States; it is commonly referred to as the Hindu Conspiracy Case. More than a hundred conspirators were named in the indictment, but many of these were absconding or were beyond the jurisdiction of the Court. Others were made approvers. The proceedings lasted from the 20 th November 1917 to the 24 th April 1918, 35 persons being in the dock, of whom seventeen were Indians, and eighteen were Germans or Americans. One of the approvers in the case stated that Germany had advanced 400,000 pounds to finance the schemes, the money to be considered a loan to India. On the last day of the trial Ram Singh, one of the prisoners, shot Ram Chand Peshawari who was also accused. He himself was promptly shot down by one of the marshals of the Court. </p>
      <p class="style2">In passing sentence Judge Van Fleet expressed regret that he could not impose a heavier sentence. </p>
      <p class="style2">“The punishment is wholly inadequate to the crime, and the penalty may well be called to the attention of Congress and so amended that it will act as a deterrent. The German defendants represent a system that the civilized world cannot tolerate.” </p>
      <p class="style2">Louis T. Hengstler, San Francisco admiralty lawyer, was the only defendant to escape a prison sentence. Judge Van Fleet had imposed a County Jail term of four months on Hengstler, but remitted it after Hengstler made a plea to the court protesting his Americanism and denouncing German imperialism. A fine of $5,000 remained against him. </p>
      <p class="style2">SENTENCES<br>
      All sentences were handed down in accordance to being convicted under Section 13 of the U.S. criminal code. </p>
