<blockquote>
T.S. Sibia heads a research library unit for biology and agriculture at the University of California, Davis. With research funding from the University, he found resources and pictures in North America, India and Hong Kong chronicling the early history of Asian Indian immigration to North America, especially the west coast of Canada and the U.S.
<p>Some of his discoveries are on his web site "Pioneer Asian Indian Immigration to the Pacific Coast" at http://www.lib.ucdavis.edu/punjab. It continues to grow since its inception in 1991 and was among the first to devote special attention to the Komagata Maru incident  (http://www.lib.ucdavis.edu/punjab/koma.html). 
 The site garners accolades from internet users from around the world and is a prominent source for information on this project.<p> T.S. Sibia, Shields Library, University of California, Davis, tssibia@sikhpioneers.net.
