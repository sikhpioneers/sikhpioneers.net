  <TR>
    <TD><B>In the year 1900 the census reported 2050 people from India on the 
	North American continent. The majority of these people were Punjabis who had 
	settled in Canada. They had come with the hope of finding work so that they 
	could improve their economic situation from what it had been in the Punjab. 
	Upon arrival in Canada they encountered numerous hardships and 
	discrimination. Canadians wanted the &quot;brown invasion&quot; to stop. They felt 
	that the growing number of Indians would take over their jobs in factories, 
	mills and lumber yards. 
      <P>It was these insecurities which led British Columbia to pass stringent 
		laws discouraging the immigration of Indians to Canada. Indians had to 
		have at least $200 on their person to enter British Columbia and had to 
		have come via direct passage from India. These were very unreasonable 
		laws as the average Indian only earned about ten cents a day. The 
		Canadian government was also pressuring steamship companies to stop 
		selling tickets to Indians. In 1907 a bill was passed denying all 
		Indians the right to vote. They were prohibited to run for public 
		office, serve on juries, and were not permitted to become accountants, 
		lawyers or pharmacists. All this was done to stop the &quot;brown Invasion.&quot; 
		On the other hand Japanese and Chinese were immigrating in unlimited 
		numbers. 
      <P>In 1914 the Komagata Maru was an outright challenge to these 
		exclusionist laws. The <A 
      href="http://legacy.sikhpioneers.net/s_komaphot.html#komamaru">Komagata Maru 
      </A>was a Japanese steamliner chartered by an affluent businessman,<A 
      name=gurdit></A><A href="http://legacy.sikhpioneers.net/s_komaphot.html#gsingh"> 
      Gurdit Singh</A>, to bring Indian immigrants to Canada. The ship's <A 
      href="http://legacy.sikhpioneers.net/marumap.html">route </A>departed from Hong 
		Kong, stopped in Japan and then headed to Canada. Its passengers 
		included 376 Indians, all Punjabis, among whom 340 were Sikhs, 12 
		Hindus, and 24 Muslims. The ship was eventually turned back at Vancouver 
		where landing was refused, and terminated eventually at Calcutta. 
      <P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Bhai Gurdit Singh, Bhai Daljit Singh and his friend Bhai Vir 
		Singh from Ferozepur were staying in the Sikh Temple of Hong Kong in 
		1914. The story of Chief Justice Hunter's judgment in Victoria, B.C., 
		about the release of 39 Asian Indians was on everybody's lips. The 
		emigrants were overjoyed. Bhai Daljit Singh began selling tickets for 
		departures to Canada. However, the British Government of Hong Kong was 
		watching the activities of Bhai Gurdit Singh because the charter of 
		Komagata Maru was in his name. Two days before the ship was to sail, 
		Bhai Gurdit Singh was arrested by Hong Kong police on the charge of 
		illegally selling tickets for an illegal voyage and the ship placed 
		under police guard. The Sikh Police of Hong Kong were often used to 
		terrorize prospective emigrants. 
        <P>&quot;Bhai Gurdit Singh was released on bail on March 24, 1914. Mr. 
		Severn, chief secretary for the Governor of Hong Kong, was known to Bhai 
		Gurdit Singh while he was in Malaya. Mr. Severn told Singh that he had 
		been waiting instructions from England and Canada, which never arrived. 
		The governor granted Singh permission for passage on April 4, 1914. 
        <P>&quot;That very day Komagata Maru left Hong Kong with 150 passengers. On 
		April 8 at Shanghai, 111 emigrants boarded the ship, and on April 14, at 
		the Port of Moji, 86, at the Yokohama port, 14 more passengers boarded 
		the Komagata Maru totalling 376 passengers. From Moji, Bhai Gurdit Singh 
		took 1500 tons of coal to sell in Canada and had intended to buy lumber 
		from B.C. to sell back in the East. Finally, the Komagata Maru left 
		Yokohama on May 3, 1914. 
        <P>&quot;[There were words of caution from several quarters to the 
		passengers.] Bhai Balwant Singh travelled in the Komagata Maru from Moji 
		to Kobe and explained to the passengers the attitude of the British 
		Government of India, Britain, and Canada towards their mission. Gyani 
		Bhagwan Singh, who was forcibly deported from Canada on November 19, 
		1913, also the passengers at Yokohama and told them the story of his own 
		deportation. Mahamad Barkatullah, the great teacher, who was professor 
		of Hindustani in the University of Tokyo, also met the passengers of 
		Maru in Yokohama. 
        <P>When Komagata Maru made it to Shanghai, a German cable company sent a 
		message to the German press announcing the departure of the steamer 
		Komagata Maru from Shanghai for Vancouver on April 14 with &quot;400 Indians 
		on board...&quot; 
        <P>&quot;The news was picked up by British press. The Vancouver daily 
		&quot;Province&quot;, published the inflammatory news report under the heading of 
		&quot;Boat Loads of Hindus on Way to Vancouver&quot;. The British Columbia press 
		began giving such headlines to their articles as &quot;Hindu Invasion of 
		Canada&quot;. <A href="http://legacy.sikhpioneers.net/koma.html#kesar">*</A> 
      </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The news of its departure reached the British Columbia authorities. 
		Their instant reaction was that &quot;Hindus would never be allowed to land 
		in Canada.&quot; The Indians who had already settled in Canada had also 
		started to prepare for the arrival of the Komagata Maru. Meetings were 
		held in the Gurdwaras concerning what actions to take. Money and 
		provisions were collected to help the passengers upon their arrival in 
		Vancouver. The entire Indian community in Canada united to fight the 
		opposition. 
      <P>On May 23, 1914, the Komagata Maru reached Vancouver and anchored near 
		Burrard Inlet. Both the Indians and the Canadian authorities had been 
		waiting for it. The Canadians wanted to send the ship back to where it 
		had originated. The Indians on the other side had lawyers, money and 
		other provisions ready to help the passengers. The Canadian authorities 
		did not let the passengers leave the boat claiming they had violated the 
		exclusionist laws. The claim was that the ship had not arrived via 
		direct passage and most passengers did not have the $200 that would have 
		qualified them to enter British Columbia. For two months the passengers 
		of the Komagata Maru, the Indians in British Columbia, and the 
		authorities of British Columbia were involved in a heated legal battle. 
		At the end of the two months only 24 passengers were given permission to 
		legally stay in Canada. On July 23, 1914 the Komagata Maru was forced to 
		leave Victoria harbor and return to Hong Kong. (See <A

      <P><I>Returned Passengers from Vancouver aboard the Komagata Maru in 
		Budge-Budge Harbor.</I> <BR>(Source: T.S.Sibia ( sikhpioneers.net )<P>The Komagata Maru approached Calcutta on September 26, 1914. As it 
		approached Calcutta, a European gunboat signaled the ship to stop. The 
		ship was put under guard and the passengers were held as prisoners. Then 
		the Komagata Maru was taken to a place called Budge Budge, about 
		seventeen miles away from its original destination of Calcutta. These 
		new developments took the passengers of the ship by surprise. After two 
		months of litigation in Canada they were not interested in any new 
		developments of this kind. Upon inquiry by Baba Gurdit Singh as to the 
		change of their course, an official informed him that the passengers 
		were being sent to Punjab via a special train. Many of the passengers 
		did not want to go to Punjab. They had business to attend to in 
		Calcutta, some wished to look for work there, and most importantly, the 
		passengers wanted to place the Guru Granth Sahib, which they had taken 
		with them on their journey, in a Calcutta Gurdwara. 
      <P>The British officials did not care what the passengers wanted. They 
		were going to be put on a train to Punjab and that would be the end of 
		it. But the passengers were adamant on going to Calcutta. They were the 
		rightful owners of the ship and the British officials had no reason to 
		keep them on the ship or send them to Punjab. They felt that some action 
		had to be taken, so they decided to march to Calcutta. 
      <P>Their main purpose on reaching Calcutta was to hand over the holy Guru 
		Granth Sahib and to see the governor. The journey was long and after 
		numerous threats by the police, they were left with no choice but to 
		head back to Budge Budge. At Budge Budge, they were ordered to board the 
		ship once again. The passengers, led by Baba Gurdit Singh, refused. A 
		policeman attacked Baba Gurdit Singh with his baton but was stopped by a 
		fellow passenger. It was at this point that firing started. Baba Gurdit 
		Singh was carried to safety. But not all passengers were to be so 
		fortunate. Twenty-nine fell victim to the bullets of British officials 
		and 20 died. Here was another senseless massacre of innocent Indians at 
		the hands of the British. The was the tragic end of the passengers of 
		the Komagata Maru.<A href="http://legacy.sikhpioneers.net/koma.html#kesar">See

      <P>The Komagata Maru returned to India's waters on September 26, 1914, 
		leaving behind only twenty-four passengers who could prove residence in 
		Canada. The repercussions of the Government's actions - the Budge Budge
