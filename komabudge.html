  injuries)</p>
<p>The Scenario of firing&#133;A Melee</p>
<p> In a communication from Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy of Bengal Governor in connection 
  with the release of detenues, it was observed that those who had been detained 
  primarily because they had suffered injuries in the occurrence, may in fact 
  be innocent since in a melee such as took it is quite as likely as a guilty 
  man to have been wounded, perhaps more so&quot;.</p>
<p>UNFOLDING OF THE EVENT<br>
  &quot;After some conversation with Sir William Duke, who had gone out and persuaded 
  the Sikhs to return to Budge, we went forward on food and arrived at the Railway 
  Station just as the Sikhs reached it and were sitting down. Then occupied the 
  road parallel to on the west side of the railway, fro which they were separated 
  by an iron railing about four feet high. Mr. Donald on arrival, asked for Gurdit 
  Singh who was pointed out to him at the end of the crowd next to the station. 
  It was rather dark by this time, but it was possible to see a man's features 
  if one looked closely. Gurdit Singh showed no disposition to move and one or 
  two European sergeants stepped forward. I presume to fetch (read apprehend) 
  him. Immediately all the Sikhs round Gurdit Singh sprang to their feet and closed 
  round him. The excitement seemed to be spreading to other people who were farther 
  away and who could not possibly have known the cause of it. I moved off several 
  paces to my own left, attempting to pacify these people and asking them to sit 
  down and keep calm, immediately a shot was fired. The flash caught my eye and 
  I should say it came from behind. Gurdit Singh and to his right that is nearer 
  to the level crossing. No sooner had the first shot been fired, a larger number 
  of others followed. The European desargeants started firing, the crowd broke 
  and a swayed, some individuals of them charging forward to attack the police. 
  I had a Browning pistol in my pocket and I drew it and fired seven shots at 
  people who were advancing on me. I was standing near the level crossing and 
  a good deal of hot hand-to-hand fighting took place between Sikhs and some men 
  of the Punjab Police. It was in this early part of the scuffle that I received 
  two bullet wounds, one in the right forearm and other one in the upper thigh. 
  The next impression I have is that the Sikhs were gathered in force round the 
  huts on the left hand side of the road as one goes from the level-crossing towards 
  the river. There were tearing away the 'bamboos' of which the huts were composed, 
  presumably to use them as 'lathis'. A good a many shots were fired from about 
  these huts. After making one or tow abortive rushes forward, the Sikhs broke 
  and fled. The troops had been standing in columns of fours some short distance 
  behind at the time the riot commenced, and from the confident and the daring 
  way in which the Sikhs attacked I feel sure that they were not aware of the 
  presence of soldiers. In my opinion some 40 or 50 shots might have been fired 
  by the rioters and they may have used about 10 or 12 pistols. I saw no Winchester 
  rifles and no swords, but as the rioters were grappling with men of the Punjab 
  Police it is quite possible they succeeded in capturing one or two swords from 
  injured policemen.&quot; (D. Petrie)</p>
<p>WERE THERE ANY FIREARMS WITH THE PASSANGERS?<br>
  From the perusa 1 of the entire reports, all that had been found in evidence 
  regarding one .38 pistol from the spot with some 'empties' of the same bore, 
  which according to the report could have belonged to the passengers since neither 
  one pistol of the same bore was recovered from one of the passengers at Midnapur 
  which may be not palpable link with the said 'riot'.<br>
  But what is left unsaid is that none from among the police officials including 
  D. Petrie had SEEN any of the passengers wielding a fire arm. The simple recovery 
  of a particular weapon FROM the spot cold mean many things. Above all, had the 
  passengers such kind of weapons and had then fired from point blank range, as 
  per the scenario of melee, the casualties of the government side must have been 
  many more. In facts and circumstances of the case, the officials hit by firearms 
  were so hit primarily because in a melee since a bullet having hit one man can 
  penetrate through and through causing injury to a second person particularly 
  in case of high velocity weapons like a riffle. Besides, the accuracy of a weapon 
  like a pistol is very limited. Hence, the bullets which hit the officials were 
  in all likelihood fired from their own side. Expectedly, there is no word about 
  the bullets recovered from the bodies of victims on the official side which 
  indeed is the clinching proof in the real of ballistics.</p>
<p> THE CONTEXT BARES IT ALL!</p>
<p> The bare facts narrated above shall fall into place once we peep into the 
  mindset of the authorities in the matter.<br>
  1. That since the &quot;steps taken from time to time meet the purposes of the 
  Governments, which in a sense, led to the riot and because only form a statement 
  of the objects can it be seen whether these steps were well or ill calculated 
  to give effects to the WISHES of the Government.</p>
<p> 2. According to D. Petrie, the Panyat police chief, &quot;he had heard Giardit 
  Singh arguing (on 29th Sept, Morning) that none of them (passengers) would go 
  ashore at Budge Budge; he also said if they had done anything wrong, a judge 
  should be sent for to take their statements, after which the Government could 
  shoot them or so what if chose; if there were any questions of dying they would 
  all die together and so on&quot;</p>
<p> 3. &quot;It is a question of common experience that Indians too often return 
  from abroad with tainted political views and diminished respect for their white 
  rulers&quot;. <br>
  and finally 5. &quot;That while some of the more ignorant (passengers) may have 
  been persuaded that the disembarkation at Budge Budge was for some sinister 
  purpose, yet the ringleaders and Gurdit Singh used it simply as an excuse because 
  they had been foiled in their attempt to make a demonstration at Howrah, as 
  they had sent telegrams from Singapore expecting a demonstration when they arrived 
  at Calcutta.'</p>
<p> So all the &quot;sinister design&quot; the government in its discretion aimed 
  at foiling was a demonstration of sorts on the arrival of passengers at Calcutta, 
  which possibly in the eyes of the authorities had to be pre-med &quot;at any 
  cost&quot; so the passengers much have to be huddled in to the prison bogies 
  of the railways to be dumped at chosen places in India at scattered places as 
  to prevent them from lodging even a peaceful protest over an issue in which 
  they were nursing a legitimate grievance.</p>
