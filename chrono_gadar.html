According to writer Khuswant Singh, this was the first revolt against the
British to free India.  He also noted that "although nine out of ten of
the rank and file of the Ghadar Party were Sikhs and the centres of their
activities were Sikh temples, since most of them, were illiterate, most of
the leaders were educated Hindus or Muslims.  This saved the Ghadar from
becoming a militant Sikh movement.  In fact, it contributed - not a little
- to make the Ghadar the most powerful terrorist movement in the history
of India's freedom movement as well as the first one to rise above
communal considerations." <br>(Source: Singh, Khuswant. <i> GHADAR 1915.  India's
first armed revolution.</i>  New Delhi: R&K Publishing House, 1966)
