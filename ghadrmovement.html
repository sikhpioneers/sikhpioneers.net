<h3>The Ghadr Movement. <br>
  Revolutionary Upsurge of 1914-15. <br>
  By Prof. Malwinder Jit Singh Waraich</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bugle of War&quot; &quot;Ailan-e-Jan&quot; 
  is sounded -of armed revolt against slavery by thousands of Indians, mostly 
  Sikhs settled in Canada, U.S.A. and western coasts since early years of the 
  century&#133;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fifty seven years have passed 
  since the Ghadr of 1857,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another mutiny is badly needed.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if your name? 'Ghadr'&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is your task? 'Ghadr'&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus proclaimed the 'Ghadr', the mouthpiece 
  of the Ghadr Party in August 1914 aptly titled &quot;Ailan-e-Jang&quot; (Declaration 
  of War). Indeed it was spontaneously responded to by thousands of Indians in 
  America who flocked to India, abandoning their hard earned dollar wealth, the 
  original purpose of their immigration, donned the robes of Martyrdom while reciting:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Challo Challiye des nun yudh 
  karan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eho Bachan te farman ho gaye.&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Let us go to our country to fight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is our ultimate compact and command.)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it not a matter of wonder that 
  those very dollars or &quot;dollar&quot; for which they had traveled to the 
  other end of the globe seemed nothing! Besides, for years after they immigrated 
  they had wailed and cried:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Desh pain dhakke bahar mile 
  dhoi naa,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sada pardesian da des koi naa&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Humiliated back home, no solace abroad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us aliens no refuge around.)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not one of the wonders of history 
  as to how these semi-literature 'rustics', many of them ex-servicemen, the proverbial 
  'yes-men' rose like a volcano!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course it was not purely incidental, 
  not purely! It was a particular scenario, which impelled them to correlate their 
  predicament in America not to the will of God but the hard fact of their Nation 
  being Slave. But mere desperation may just demoralize, unless it is coupled 
  with some positive option to respond to the challenge of the circumstances.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, from a human angle, it was 
  a blend of 'brain' and 'brawn' which combined to work wonders like this. There 
  is an apt anecdote about Lala Hardial, the famed intellectual and the founder 
  General Secretary of the Party. Which in a lighter mood, sitting among his fellow 
  Ghadrites in 'Yunganter Ashram' the party office on Wood street, San Francisco, 
  he shared his innermost feelings with them: 'well I have spend my best part 
  of life and had exhausted myself in studies and had concluded that this is the 
  best job i.e. Ghadr; but now I am to feeble to exert much physically, whereas 
  the same lesson you people learnt while laboring in factories and farms and 
  also retain the physical vigor to act and implement. You are indeed great!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slogan, &quot;Like 1857&quot; 
  was one which was within the reasonable gasp of all of them, which signified 
  a joint endeavor of masses and soldiery. To help them, Veer Savarkar's book 
  extolling &quot;1857&quot; as the First War of Independence was at hand. Excerpts 
  from the book were serialized in 'Ghadr' paper regularly.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significantly, though party was named 
  at the time of its formal birth in March 1913 as &quot;Hindi Association of 
  Pacific Coast; it became famous as Ghadr Party precisely because first its mouthpiece 
  paper was named &quot;Ghadr&quot; and also because its ideology was 'Ghadr'. 
  Its founding President was Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna, vice president Baba Kesar 
  Singh Thathgarh, General Secretary Lala Hardyal (succeeded by Bhai Santakh Singh 
  in March 1914), cashier Martyr Pandit Kashi Ram Marauli.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party though predominantly consisting 
  of Sikh, and Gurdwaras like that of Stockton and Vancouver being the virtual 
  storm centers of the Party, it was secular to the organization. In those days 
  of orthodoxy in the matters of sharing a kitchen all used to dine in the common 
  kitchen. There was no remuneration for even the while timers who stayed in the 
  &quot;Yugantar Ashram&quot; and only a pocket money of one dollar a day were 
  given. Baba Sohan Singh had written in his autobiography &quot;Jeewan Sangram&quot; 
  that once an Irish revolutionary stayed there and when he found the food we 
  took, he was almost shocked in disbelief and propounded that for us, the day 
  of liberation could not be for off!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war cry was &quot;Bande Matram' 
  adopted from a famous novel in Bengali by Bankim Chander Chatterji which denotes 
  'Mother I bow to Thee!' and it was inscribed invariably on the top corners of 
  the front page of 'Ghadr; and in the middle the inspiring lines from the sacred 
  writings of Guru Nanak Dev ji: &quot;Jau tao prem khelanka chao, sir dhar talee 
  galee moree ao&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(If you seek to engage in the name 
  of Love, Then step in my way with head on thy palm).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not the least in significance, 
  the Ghadrites in their own homespun idiom improvised poetry, which, without 
  mentioning the name of authors, was regularly published in 'Ghadr'. Later it 
  was compiled in compilations named 'Ghadr'. Later it was compiled in compilations 
  named 'Ghard Goonj; serialized and published. Seldom in history such wonders 
  had been wrought by &quot;Poetry&quot;! Practically ,every Ghadrite had memorized 
  a bunch of these poems to be recited by singing or otherwise and literally it 
  was like 'spitting fire'. Shorn of oratorical talents, this was indeed the communication 
  weapon to motivate villagers, soldiers in barracks and the students in hostels 
  for Ghadr.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All said, the party failed to attain 
  its avowed objective of overthrow of alien rule. On arrival many of the top 
  leaders were nabbed on ports itself since their arrival and mood was too well 
  known to the police. Recovering from the shock, they managed to put their act 
  together and collaborated with veteran revolutionaries like Rash Bihari Bose 
  and entrusted him with the leadership. This is itself a unique quality, not 
  to bother about 'leadership so rare even among revolutionaries.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having managed to build a 'formidable' 
  organization according to the Judgement of the Ghadr cases called 'Lahore Conspiracy 
  Cases' the proximate cause of their proposed revolt of 19 Feb 1915 was the secret 
  leakage of their plans via Kirpal Singh a spy who managed to penetrate the tip 
  ring of its leadership.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expectedly it was followed by trials 
  before &quot;Special Tribunals&quot; where no &quot;Vakil&quot; (Council), &quot;Daleel&quot; 
  (pleadings) or &quot;appeal&quot; was entertained. So dozens were sentenced 
  to death and hanged secretly and their ashes/remains till date remained cremated/buried 
  anonymously under the debris (now demolished) Lahore Central Jail, presently 
  a shopping complex. Those spared death were consigned to Cellular Jail in Andaman, 
  a veritable hell on earth.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This account of the movement would 
  remain incomplete without reference to Koma Gata Maru episode, though not directly 
  related to the Ghadar Party as such. The Canadian Government in connivance with 
  British Government was hell bent to stop Indians' entry. So they cleverly imposed 
  a condition on Asian immigrants of &quot;direct voyage: from their country being 
  fully aware that no such ships start from India. To circumvent this handicap, 
  Baba Gurdit Singh contracted a Japanese ship Koma Gata Maru and booked around 
  400 passengers to Canada. They were left stranded in the Canadian coast of Vancouver 
  for two months on arrival, assaulted, starved even of water but not allowed 
  to land. They were only provided with rations for return voyage. Enraged they 
  sailed back but in the meantime First World War had started. Baba Sonhan Singh 
  Bhakana, the president was entrusted with a consignment of pistols and ammunition 
  plus the Ghadar literature to link up with the passengers, through their leadership, 
  which de did at Yokohama in Japan, The British Government in India treated all 
  the passengers as dangerous and disallowed any one of them to disembark on the 
  way. Ultimately the ship arrived at Budge Budge port near Kolkotta on 29 the 
  September 1914 where the army and police 'welcomed' them with indiscriminate 
  firing resulting in at least 20 deaths and many injured, the rest being put 
  in to jail<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Babas who survived these trials 
  continued to struggle in all mass movements and organizations working for freedom 
  and justice.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, in the words of Baba 
  Sohan Singh Bhakna, Ghadar Party has the distinction of being a trail blazer 
  in demanding freedom, liberty and equality for Indians, in which endeavor it 
  did not attain immediate success, but it left behind a rich legacy to inspire 
  a succession of revolutionaries including Legendary Bahgat Singh who regarded 
  young Hero Kartar Singh Sarabha his role model, the same 19 years old lad fondly 
  remembered by Baba ji till last breath in December 1968 as &quot;My General&quot;.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long lives the Ghadar spirit!</p>
