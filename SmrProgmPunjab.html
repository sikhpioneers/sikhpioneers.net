<P class=style8> The program will provide six weeks of instruction in Punjab Studies. The work includes the learning of Punjabi (50 hours), and history and culture of the region (90 hours). The goal of the program is to impart substantial academic information about the history and culture of the region and provide an environment for discussion and exploration.</P>
<P class=style8> It is structured around a daily schedule of lectures and activities lasting  six to eight hours (Monday through Friday). The weekends are used for  extensive travel in the region. Participants are expected to attend all  activities. The teaching of Punjabi is offered at two levels. Elementary  Punjabi is intended for those who have had no prior exposure to the language, and Advanced Punjabi includes literary readings partly modified  every year to accommodate the participants' areas of interests. For those  on FLAS, 30 hours of language coaching will be arranged at the additional  cost of $ 10 per hour. Note: This is not a language intensive program. </P>
<P class=style8> The program is open to both graduate and undergraduate students. Special  requests from independent scholars are also considered; they are welcome to  use the infra-structure of the program and make use of its activities while  pursuing their own research projects.</P>
<P class=style8> The expense for each participant is $1,950, which includes instruction,  room and board shared with another person, and travel within the Punjab.  (If a participant needs a single room that can be arranged for an extra fee  of $400). Meals on the weekends are the responsibility of the participants.  Limited financial assistance is available for citizens of the United  States. </P>
