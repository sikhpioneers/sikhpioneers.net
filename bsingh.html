<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The liquor store provided another 
  contribution to my education. It brought wrestlers to our village. From them 
  I learned the art of wrestling and became engrossed in physical culture generally. 
  I had my share of mistakes and mischief. To a certain extent all beings, particularly 
  the young, like to imitate. This may be nature’s way of alluring us to learn. 
  I had to prove things for myself and though venturesome, there was a serious 
  side to my nature. Till I reached maturity the witnessing of any inspiring feat 
  such as poetry, music, clarity of expression, outstanding physical development, 
  skill, wrestling and the like, would act as a challenge to my ability. “Could 
  I do like wise?” I had to try and find out. There is no denying the influence 
  of these early questionings.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> At the age of twenty I entered Updeshak 
  College at Gujranwala for the study of music under the direction of Master Isher 
  Singh, Giani, a personal friend of my father. After a few weeks I overheard 
  a remark about myself, make by a senior student also by the name of Ishar Singh, 
  who observed: “What does this grand-father expects to learn in his old age?”. 
  This casual remark not intended for my ears, changed the course of my studies, 
  and who knows, may be the direction of my life. After consulting with Master 
  Ishar Singh, my studies, namely, Budhivan, Vidvan and Giani. I completed the 
  three that year. During my post-graduated term I was appointed teacher at the 
  same College, and the following year, 1907, lecturer on Sikhism, in which capacity 
  I traveled extensively covering Northern India from Delhi to Peshawar. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This was also the year of the Punjab 
  Uprising caused by the increase in land revenue. The agitation that started 
  in 1902 over the Partition of Bengal, on the same communal lines from which 
  Pakistan was to emerge forty-five years later, had developed into an active 
  Revolutionary Movement by 1905 and had split of the Congress Party at its Surat 
  Session, into Radical Nationalists under the leadership of Sri Bal Gangadhar 
  Tilak and the Conservative “Ji-Hazoor” Party, led by Mr. Gokhle. Being a lecturer 
  I came in direct contact with many Revolutionists, especially Sardar Ajit Singh, 
  with whom I shared the platform several times. From them I received my Baptism 
  in Nationalism. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through 1908 and the early part of 
  1909, I taught school at Daska, Distt. Sialkot, during which time I was privileged 
  to meet scholarly Sant HarBilas under whom I studied the six systems of Hindu 
  Philosophy, the Upanishads, the Bhagvad Gita and other classics. I benefited 
  immensely from my Master’s teaching especially Vedanta and the Nyaya-system 
  of Logic which he taught with his unique penetrability. His rare gift of putting 
  a complicated idea into simple words, remains with me still, also gems of wisdom 
  he imparted:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> “If you cannot be helpful to others, 
  do not put obstacles in their path, natural obstacles are difficult enough.”</FONT><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
  </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“Do not allow anything to enter your 
  being that will degrade you, nor express anyting for which you will have caused 
  to regret later.” </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During this time I remained politically 
  active. In the middle of 1908, after the suppression of the Uprising in Punjab, 
  the Revolutionary Movement went underground. Lala Lajpat Rai was arrested and 
  sent to Mandaly; Sufi and Ajit Singh left for Persia and in August of 1909, 
  it became necessary that I had also to leave India. Under an assumed name I 
  traveled covering Burma, Siam, Malay Staits, Java, Sumatra, Borneo and Singapore 
  everywhere preaching Nationalism. Though direct advocacy of the overthrow of 
  the British Yoke was neither advisable nor feasible yet, speaking on Sikh History 
  and the Organization of the Sikh Brotherhood for the sake of India’s Liberation 
  from foreign rule as well as for love of one’s own country, became the medium 
  enabling me to rouse the spirit of Nationalism among my fellow countrymen. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By coming face to face for the first 
  time, with the extent of Sectionalism, partly a result of the social conquest 
  of India, I was to learn a most important lesson. While in the Malay Straits, 
  I was ordered to leave Ipoh, by a Subedar from my own district, for the simple 
  reason that I had offered the help Captain Gurdit Singh, a Sikh brother, to 
  collect funds for the Girl’s High School at Moga, Distt. Ferosepur. I had never 
  before realized the existing antagonism between different sections of my own 
  Punjab. This shocking experience aroused in me a deeper sense of dedication 
  to the urgent need of National unity among ourselves. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, I reached Hong Kong in March 
  1910. My intention was to proceed to the United States, but upon the request 
  of the Central Sikh Temple Committee there, I became Granthi instead for three 
  years. The Indian Colony in Hong Kong at that time numbered about 7,000 comprising 
  Rajputs, Moslems, Hindus and Sikhs in various profession and occupations. Some 
  were in the Army or Police, others merchants, guards, watchmen, ect. My position 
  as Granthi gave easy access to all strata of society, including the army, where 
  I could come and go at will. Here I did the best National work within the range 
  of my knowledge and capacity. Except for a few Subedare the entire Aray and 
  Officers were ready to take up the cause of India’s Independence. I was assured 
  that Hong Kong could be captured in a few hours. This information later, was 
  relayed to Dr. Sun Yat Sen who did not think China strong enough them, to incur 
  the hostility of the British. While in Hong Kong I was twice arrested, one in 
  1911 and again in 1912; both times for preaching sediton, but on each occasion 
  I was released. Meanwhile the Sunday meetings at the Temple were being attended 
  not only by Sikhs, but by Moslems, Rajputs, Hindus and Pathans as well. I had 
  succeeded in unifying the Indians and considering my work accomplished I resigned 
  as priest in April 1913 and left for Canada. On leaving I was presented with 
  a “Siropao, a purse and a gold Medal”. </FONT> </P>
<P> <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">May 1913 found me organizing our 
  countrymen in British Columbia, Canada. There I clashed with an Englishman by 
  the name of Hopkinsen who had been sent by the British Government of India, 
  in order to keep the community of 4,000 Indians living in Canada, disunited. 
  It was due to his zeal, plus the cooperation of our traitors, that the United 
  League and Guru Nanak Mining Company ceased to function. Both had previously 
  been organized by Prof. Teja Singh, M.A. I succeeded in re-organizing them and 
  in unifying not only the Sikhs among themselves, but the Indian community as 
  a whole, Moslems and Hindus, hence the clash. Two months after my arrival I 
  was arrested but released on a $2,000 bail. There was no case against me.<BR>
  </FONT><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
  However, Mr. Hopkinson who, besides being official interpreter for the Indian 
  was also Inspector of Immigration, together with Mr. Reed, Immigration Commissioner, 
  never relinquished their efforts until they secured a special order from the 
  Governor General of Canada for my deportation. Thus five months after my landing 
  in Canada, I was dragged out in the middle of the night of November 18, 1913, 
  from the home of Babu Harnam Singh (later martyred for the cause), and deported, 
  even though two writs of Habeas Corpus had been issued, one in Victoria, the 
  other in Vancouver, B.C. I was man-handled, injured physically, literally thrown 
  on the &quot;Empress of Japan&quot; destination, India. Later, this same Hopkinson 
  was shot and killed by one of our own, Bhai Mewa Singh, who paid the full penalty, 
  being hanged. Thus was my exit from Canada affected on November 19, 1913.<BR>
  <BR>
  Inspite of my injuries, I managed to escape my guard once in Japan. Continuing 
  the journey to India would have been fatal. I was aware of the fate of a &quot;rebel&quot; 
  once in the hands of offended oligaroh. In Japan I stayed with Maulana Maulvi 
  Barak Tullah, who was a professor of languages at the Imperial University in 
  Tokyo. The need to secure arms and ammunition caused me to leave Japan in March 
  1914 for Germany on a Japanese ship, but I was discovered by the British in 
  Shanghai. Upon reaching Hong Kong a warrant was issued for my arrest and the 
  ship was searched. However through the assistance of the Captain, I was disguised 
  as a Japanese after losing my beard and hair, and set abroad an Australian Cargo 
  ship on its way to Japan. Once in Tokyo, I rejoined Prof. Barak Tullah and for 
  the second time met Dr. Sun Yat Sen and also the Sung Sisters who were on their 
  way from the United States to China. Later, one of them was destined to become 
  Mae. Sun Yat Sem and the other Mae. Chiang.<BR>
  <BR>
  Prof. Barak Tullah and myself decided to leave for the United States and on 
  May 23rd 1914 we landed in San Francisco. We immediately went to the Gadar Ashram, 
  430 Hill St., where to our dismay we learned that Dr. Har Dayal, one of the 
  Founders, had voluntarily left for Europe in order avoid being deported. He 
  had been arrested in March. The Gadar Ashram and been left in the care of a 
  Committee presided over Sri Sohan Singh, Bhakna. Shorlty after our arrival, 
  I was elected President, Prof. Barak Tullah, Vice President and Pandit Ram Chandra 
  given the responsibility of the &quot;Hindustan Gadar&quot;, our weekly official 
  publication. Moreover the three of us were appointed Commissiouers. Five months 
  later, the 1st World War was declared.<BR>
  <BR>
  A commission Meeting was held at 436 Hill St., San Francisco on August 15th, 
  1914 to reconsider and revise our plans, disturbed and altered by the advent 
  of the War. At this meeting the following three decisions were taken:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First: In the name of India Nationalism, 
  we should declare OPEN WARFARE against British Rule in India and proclaim India 
  a FREE and SOVEREIGN REPUBLIC. Up to now agitations had been carried on by intelligentsia 
  against particular grievances or for specific needs. Now, it was decided to 
  advocate the open foster REBELLION on MASS scale which would be difficult for 
  the British to suppress or to bribe its leaders.<BR>
  <BR>
  Second: All means should be used; every advantage taken, no matter from what 
  quarter it may come. Connections should be established with active Revolutionary 
  Movements of other countries of and central Governments such as Germany, Austria, 
  etc., with nations whose interests and relations were in direct conflict with 
  the British.<BR>
  <BR>
  Third: The collection of funds, armaments, etc., should be intensified and students 
  sent to be trained in the Military Academies of other Nations whenever and wherever 
  possible. Appeals should be made to Indians everywhere to proceed to India and 
  start fighting for &quot;freedom&quot;. The Gadar Press could be used to serve 
  these various aims.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Other points equally urgent were 
  discussed from every angle within the range of our knowledge and the existing 
  conditions. We were fully aware of our lack of facilities in transportation, 
  communication, military equipment, material, men and money with which to wage 
  a successful revolution. We were also conscious that we would have to struggle 
  not only against the British, but against all her allies who were enjoying concession 
  at our expense. It was also clear to us that outside the Revolutionary Movement 
  in Bengal the rest of the country was asleep and wholly unprepared though willing 
  to cooperate and be drained of men, money and material by their British Masters. 
  Fight they MUST, but not for freedom of their country but against a nation with 
  whom they had no quarrel, but whose rising power the British could not tolerate. 
  Black clouds of despair hung all over our Indian horison. Our one ray of hope 
  was our Contrymen's love for their Motherland. We hoped and dared to expect 
  that through our appeal some would wake.<BR>
  <BR>
  The immediate question was: &quot;Shall we DARE defy British Imperialism or 
  shall we remain INACTIVE and let the present opportunity pass by?&quot; A CHALLENGE 
  was presented to our manhood, INDIA'S MANHOOD, which could only be met in a 
  &quot;manly&quot; manner through action.<BR>
  <BR>
  The decision was unanimous: &quot;accept the challange and ACT.&quot; Better 
  to fail in the attempt than to do NOTHING. Our decision was &quot;TO GO AND 
  DIE&quot;, thus proving to ourselves and to the world that India, in spite of 
  their old age, was ALIVE, a nation capable of rejuvenation.<BR>
  <BR>
  Henoe, &quot;THE DECLARATION OF WAR&quot; which appeared i the &quot;Hindustan 
  Gadar&quot; date (?) August or September, 1914.<BR>
  </FONT><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
  The outcome of this meeting was that Prof. Barak Tullah, a Moslem Divine, well 
  versed in the languages of the Near East was sent to Afghanistan, Persia Turkey, 
  etc. Pandit Ram Chandra was to remain in San Francisco in publication of the 
  &quot;Hindustan Ghadar&quot; and I was assigned to cover the Far East and to 
  return once more to Asia. My ventures there were numerous, dangerous and some 
  doomed to failure, but it was during this period that I met Shri Rash Behari 
  Boss, Mr. M.N. Roy, Lala Lajpat Rai and others. All these events and full details 
  of other important facts not even mentioned in this &quot;brief sketch&quot; 
  are described in the &quot;Autobiography&quot; under preparation. Suffice it 
  to say that I traveled through Japan, North and South China, Korea, Manchuria, 
  and the Phillipines. I witnessed the Third Chinese Revolution; the first was 
  in 1911 when I was priest in Hong Kong; the second was when I met Dr. San Yat 
  Sen after he fled from Shanghai in 1913, the third, in 1916, when we met again 
  following his failure to oust Yuan Shi Kai.<BR>
  </FONT><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
  It was in Nanking, China, while on an interned German Gunboat that I wrote a 
  booklet entitled &quot;Junk or Azadi&quot; - &quot;War and Freedom&quot; - which 
  embodied the aims discussed at our Commission Meeting in San Francisco and which 
  was distributed among Indians all over Malaya, Hongkong, Shanghi, and in the 
  Phillipines wherever Punjabi was read. It was my first effort in writing and 
  approximately 2,00,000 copies were circulated. They were also sent to the 35,000 
  Indian War Prisoners held in Germany, most of whom were Sikhs. As a result of 
  the &quot;Declaration of War&quot; and the appeal to our countrymen published 
  in the &quot;Hindustan Gadar&quot; and this booklet - &quot;Jung aur Azadi&quot; 
  - more than 10, 000 patriots from all over the world responded by going to India 
  to fight for her freedom.<BR>
  <BR>
  It was due to their activities and the trials in the so-called &quot;Conspiracy 
  Cases&quot; at Delhi, Lucknow, Lahore, Amritsar, Meerut, Mandaly, etc., that 
  the &quot;Rowlett Act&quot; which in turn produced the massacare of Jalianwala 
  Bagh, in Amritsar, and the awakening of India. It was in this manner that the 
  field contribution of the Gadar Party be denied?<BR>
  <BR>
  It is common knowledge that these same Patriots, these brave men ,were banded 
  as out-throats and thugs, that they were hunted down, spied upon, denounced 
  as disturbers of peace, treated as criminals, even shot, hanged and imprisoned. 
  This &quot;Saga of Heroism&quot; is still to be written.<BR>
  <BR>
  While in the Phillipines I was arrested twice and ordered to leave Manila. Twice 
  also did I escape arrest in China, once in Sing Tao which was under Japanese 
  Martial law, and two days later in Tientsin. It was while in China also that 
  warrants were issued for my arrest as well as those of Sri Rash Behari Bose 
  and Bhai Gopal Singh.<BR>
  <BR>
  I left China in June 1916 landing in San Francisco sometime in July but as I 
  did so without passport of ticket my stay was of three days only. I then proceeded 
  to South America by way of Panama. There the British Minister has informed the 
  foreign Office that I was a Moslem and since Panama is a Catholic country opposed 
  to polygamy,-which is reputed to be practiced by the Moslems- I was automatically 
  disqualified and ordered to leave. Such was the might of the British veracity.<BR>
  <BR>
  On my way to America abroad a U. S Fruit Company's ship, I was removed at Havana, 
  held for three days by the immigration and sent back to Panama without reason. 
  To this day I have been unable to learn how any Cuban authority could take a 
  passenger from an American ship and by what law my journey was interrupted. 
  Nor did the U.S Fruit Co. ever refund my ticket which was from Panama to Galveston, 
  Texas. In Panama on the advice of General George Goethal, then Governor of the 
  Canal Zone, and who was also the builder of the Canal, I gave up going to South 
  America and re-entered the United States legally, landing in New York October 
  11, 1916.<BR>
  <BR>
  Mr. Harish Chandra Sharma, son of Mahatma Munshi Ram was in New York to meet 
  me. He had been sent by Pandit Ram Chandra with $3,000 and an urgent request 
  that I proceed immediately to Germany to work among the 35,000 War Prisoners 
  there. During my short stay in San Francisco in July, I had been informed that 
  all was not well at Gadar Ashram. There was a general revolt against Panjit 
  Ram Chandra for his misuse of authority and Gadar Funds, but I could not take 
  up these complaints then, because of my illegal entry. Now, I decided to go 
  to California instead of proceeding to Germany as directed and from here begins 
  the most devastating chapter of my life.<BR>
  <BR>
  Six months later the United States entered the War, April 7th, 1917. Twenty 
  four hours later, nineteen of us were arrested as well as Germans, Irish and 
  others and the famous &quot;San Francisco Conspiracy Case&quot;, for the violation 
  of the neutrality of the United States, began. Besides this international struggle 
  I uncovered the sordid mess of Pandit Ram Chandra's doings within the Party 
  itself. The Constitution prepared by Dr. Har Dayal had been destroyed, and a 
  new one written and approved according to which all authority of the Gadar Party 
  was vested in Panjit Ram Chandra and incorporated with the support of two other 
  members, Mr. Gobin Behari Lal &amp; Mr. Harish Chandra Sharma as well as the 
  &quot;Hindustan Gadar&quot;, the Party's Official Organ, as their own private 
  Corporation. Gadar Funds were misappropriated. More than $15,000 cash had been 
  deposited in the name of Panjit's wife. Properties were purchased in the name 
  of Panjit's personal friends who were not even members of the Party. The two 
  lots on Wood St., where the present Ashram stands, had been put in the name 
  of Mr. Reed, and American gentleman.<BR>
  <BR>
  Twenty such charges were brought before the meeting of the Executive Board held 
  at Gadar Headquarters, 436 Hill St., S.F., in the presence of 27 members of 
  the Committee appointed by Pandit Ram Chandra himself. After hearing but three 
  of these charges, Pandit Ram Chandra ran out of the meeting refusing to return. 
  A two member commission was then appointed to investigate the charges. The misdeeds 
  were revealed and the charges confirmed whereupon the Gadar Council demanded 
  and obtained Pandit Ram Chandra's resignation. It was following the disgraceful 
  dismissal that he constructed to build the present Ashram at 5 Wood Street in 
  opposition to the legally constituted Gadar Centre. More-over, he bought a new 
  press and issued a second &quot;Hindustan Gadar Paper&quot; in open defiance, 
  continuing to do until his death. Thus it was that two Hindustan Gadar Papers 
  appeared at the same time in San Francisco (Details of these happenings are 
  included in the &quot;History of the Gadar Party&quot; published soon, though 
  requests were made to suppress them.)<BR>
  <BR>
  In the &quot;San Francisco Conspiracy Case&quot; three of us, Dr. Tarak Nath 
  Das, Bhai Santokh Singh and myself drew the maximum sentence of two years at 
  McNeils' Island Federal Penitentiary and Gopal Singh one year plus one day. 
  Two of the others served light sentences at the City Jail and the rest were 
  freed. The &quot;Case&quot; was considered the biggest in the State of California, 
  it continued for six months which is a matter of court record. As my bail had 
  been set at $25,000, the highest amount of any, I remained in jail allowing 
  other their liberty. Federal Judge Van Fleet before pronouncing the sentence 
  addressed himself to me, say: &quot;I regret, Bhagwan Singh, that the law does 
  not allow me to impose stiffer sentence upon you than the two year limit. I 
  will recommend that the penalty in such cases be increased.&quot; Our lawyer, 
  Mr. Timothy Healy, at this point requested His Honour to consider the fact that 
  I had already served six months in jail, whereupon instead of my sentence being 
  increased, His Honour begrudgingly reduced it to eighteen months. According 
  to the San Francisco &quot;Chronicle&quot; the &quot;Conspiracy Case&quot; cost 
  the British Government three and a half million dollars and the United States, 
  five hundred thousand. I have often wondered who was responsible for opening 
  the case.<BR>
  Almost three months before the end of my sentence, &quot;Deportation proceedings&quot; 
  were brought against me by the immigration authorities&#133;This episode is 
  also given in detail in the Autobiography&#133;The final issue was, that failing 
  all other means, the Gadra Party delegated me to Washington, D.C. and plead 
  my own case, which I did in 1920, the case was dropped.<BR>
  <BR>
  The reorganization of the Gadar Party occupied the next period. I also attempted 
  farming but was not very successful mainly due to the great depression at that 
  time. Ten thousand Banks went under and I too failed with them. In the meantime 
  I was recalled to the Gadar Party, however I definitely resigned on January 
  1st, 1928.<BR>
  <BR>
  From 1928 I was engaged in my own work, writing, lecturing, teaching. For years 
  I had made special studies in Creative Psychology and Sociology, evolving a 
  simple, practical and scientific philosophy for modern needs. It is a &quot;Pattern 
  Theory for Adult Education&quot;. This I was now prepared to test and to unfold. 
  I have spoken in every city of the United States with a population over 300,000 
  except in the State of Maine. I have addressed High Schools, Colleges, Universities, 
  Associations, Clubs, Churches, private organizations, as well as Radio audiences; 
  also have founded the &quot;Humanology Society&quot; and organized &quot;The 
  American Institute of Culture&quot; with affiliated &quot;Self Culture Association&quot; 
  in many large cities. I have written several books. There is quite a deal of 
  unedited, unpublished material still pending covering various subjects of human 
  interest besides a library of three hundred tapes and a gross records embodying 
  the &quot;Fundamentals&quot; of my work.<BR>
  <BR>
  In 1948 at the request of my countrymen, once more I gave up my own work and 
  returned to the Pacific Coast to serve them holding meetings, editing and publishing 
  a monthly periodical &quot;Nav-Yug&quot; for eighteen months. As soon as India 
  was FREE, I applied for my passport to return home, but in spite of repeated 
  enquiries. I did not receive it for over two years.<BR>
  <BR>
  At long last, upon the invitation of Sri Partap Singh Kairon, Chief Minister 
  of the State of Punjab, after nearly fifty years in foreign lands, I am HOME. 
  I left incognito under an assumed name to work for freedom, I return a FREE 
  man on an Indian ship under own flag.<BR>
  <BR>
  My dear Countrymen and Fellow Citizens,<BR>
  I salute and greet you! I leave to your imagination the ecstatic joy I am privileged 
  to experience. By Birth and by Choice, I am an INDIAN, human in disposition 
  and attitude and scientific in outlook. I have national pride both racial and 
  geographical; am not slow at learning new lessons and have no mental nor spiritual 
  rheumatism to prevent moving in any direction or to destroy my flexibility.<BR>
  So much for now&#133;My personal life is not for public interest. If more is 
  required of my activities it is all at your disposal. I hope I have not bored 
  you with this accumulation of facts, movements, failures, impression and aspiration&#133;.</FONT></P>
