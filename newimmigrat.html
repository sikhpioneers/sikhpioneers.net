<p><font color="#FF0000"><h2><a name="immigration">Immigration</a> Legislation</h2></font></p>
The Immigration Act of 1917 dictated that Indian laborers were no longer able to
 enter the United States; their native country existed in the &quot; barred zone &quot; identified in the Act.  And the Immigration 
Law of 1924 prevented recent immigrants from retrieving family members from their native country.  Thus, wives and
 children were unable to join their husbands and fathers.  One other law discriminated against East Indians.
<p><h3>The California <a name="alien"> Alien</a> Land Law </h3>
The California Alien Land Law of 1913, revised in 1920, prevented immigrants from owning and leasing their own land, making it a difficult struggle for those who made their living as farmers.  A second indication of the discrimination which existed toward East Indians appeared in the Stephens report.
<br>
<p><h3>The<a name="thind">Thind</a>Case</h3>
In 1923, the verdict of United States v. <a href="s_usphot.html#thind">Bhagat Singh Thind</a> (261 US 204) became a major
 setback for East Indians struggling to survive and exist in a new land.  Justice Sutherland decided that East  Indian  immigrants, referred to as Hindus, were "aliens ineligible to citizenship."  They were designated as Caucasian, but this did not mean that they were "white."  Citizenship was only allowed for whites and persons of African descent; thus, East Indians were not  allowed citizenship in the country.  The 1946 Luce Celler bill changed this.</h3>
