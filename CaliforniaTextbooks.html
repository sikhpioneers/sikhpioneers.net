						THE CONTROVERSIAL IMAGE: Guru Nanak, founder of the Sikh 
						religion. Miniature portrait on ivory. Lahore, late 19th 
						CE.</div>
				</div>
				SACRAMENTO: The force of conviction and a campaign run in a 
				sober and intelligent way has finally borne fruit. Guru Nanak 
				Dev&#39;s misleading, indefensible image in the seventh grade school 
				text books in California will appear no more.
				<p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;The image itself was offensive to the Sikh 
				community,&quot; Thomas Adams, director of the Curriculum Frameworks 
				and Instructional Resources Division of the State Education 
				Department, was quoted by the New York Times. &quot;And it wasn&#39;t 
				defensible on the issue of accuracy, because it is from a later 
				period&quot; than the one in which Guru Nanak<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> 
				lived.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">The WSN, in its February 28 edition, had 
				raised the issue prominently with a lead article on the op-ed 
				page by Onkar S. Bindra wherein he had focussed on the picture 
				on Page 95 of &quot;An Age of Voyages: 1350-1600,&quot; the book used 
				since last fall. Guru Nanak in this image was shown with a 
				trimmed beard holding a few beads and wearing a crown. Sikhs 
				complained about the image, saying the portrait makes Nanak look 
				like a Muslim chieftain. The picture, which hangs in a museum in 
				London, was originally painted in the 19th century, after 
				Muslims ruled India. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Guru Nanak and a crown? The image of 
				Sikhism&#39;s founder is anathema to everything they believe about 
				the Guru. After months of lobbying by Sikhs, the California 
				Board of Education voted unanimously on Thursday asking 
				publisher Oxford University Press to remove the portrait from 
				future printings, and to provide a sticker with another image or 
				text to place over the portrait in existing copies.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"></p>

						Onkar Singh Bindra</div>
				</div>
				Onkar S Bindra, who sits on the board of the gurdwara in West 
				Sacramento, had an argument devastating in its simplicity: &quot;It 
				says he&#39;s the founder of the Sikh religion. The founder of the 
				Sikh religion should look like a Sikh.&quot; Bindra, a Sacramento 
				Sikh, has spent his retirement educating the public about his 
				religion. He had also objected to the alternative image offered 
				by the publishers which was from an 18th century painting that 
				showed the Guru wearing a red hat and trim beard. That image 
				made their founder look like a Hindu. The red mark on his 
				forehead and the janeyu (sacred Hindu thread) are both strong 
				symbols from Hinduism. Casper Grathwohl, publisher of Oxford 
				University Press, refused to print the Sikh style image and 
				insisted that the older images are more accurate.
				<p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Sikhs number about 24 million, comprise one 
				of the world&#39;s youngest religions, and nearly 500,000 of them 
				are in the United States. More than a lakh live in California 
				and it was here that they pushed to have the picture removed 
				from the text. The efforts began immediately when the book first 
				arrived in schools at the start of the academic year.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Twenty-one Sikhs had come from San Jose in 
				the South to Placerville in the North, representing 
				congregations of Gurdwaras in El Sobrante, Fremont, Sacramento 
				and San Jose in Northern California to attend the Public Hearing 
				of the State Board of Education (SBE) in the California 
				Department of Education (CDE) building in Sacramento on March 8.</p>

				</div>
				&quot;I provided relevant material to the SBE members on March 7. 
				These included<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>copies of letters of Dr Narinder 
				Singh Kapany, Noel Q. King, Professor Emeritus (U.C. Santa Cruz) 
				and the SGPC, written by them to CDE/SBE officers,&quot; Bindra told 
				the WSN.
				<p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">The development was just another example of 
				a textbook change prompted by concerns about giving offense to 
				any racial, ethnic or religious groups.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">During his public comment, Bindra 
				circulated to SBE Members two presentation portfolios, one 
				depicting how Sikh Calendars, five Punjabi weeklies and one 
				Hindi weekly circulated in California use only Sikh style 
				pictures of Guru Nanak. The other showed pictures of Guru Nanak 
				in ten books on World Religions, written by non-Sikhs and 
				published in USA or UK and one authored by non-Sikhs and 
				published in India, all with only Sikh style pictures.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Publisher’s claim that the present picture 
				was selected as being the oldest one available is not tenable, 
				because Art Books have much older images. However, those too do 
				not depict Guru Nanak as a Sikh. Just because it is old, does 
				not mean it is right. Gurtej Singh Cheema, M.D., circulated to 
				the Board Members, six large transparencies of old murals in the 
				old and historic Baba Atal Rai Gurdwara in the Golden Temple 
				Complex, Amritsar, Punjab. Apparently, these murals are older 
				than the offensive picture chosen by OUP. Besides, these are in 
				the Sikh style. The painting which the SGPC recommended to the 
				CDE/SBE bears strong resemblance with Guru Nanak in these old 
				murals, especially regarding turban and unshorn facial hair.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Gurprit S, Hansra, an engineer, 
				high-lighted the fact that Sikhs have suffered 
				disproportionately high percentage of hate crimes because of 
				their mistaken identity. Dr JP Singh, an earthquake engineer &amp; 
				President of the El Sobrante Gurdwara, also stressed the same 
				problem, and said, “A Sikh style picture of Guru Nanak will help 
				correct the erroneous perception.” Further, he recommended that 
				the SBE should include the USDOJ poster, Common Sikh American 
				Head Coverings, in the social sciences educational materials.</p>
				</BR>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Col. Paramjit Singh Gahra, a lawyer, said, 
				“I had an occasion to see a monument dedicated to Nanak Lama in 
				Sikkim, India.”&nbsp; Although such statues in Tibet, Sikkim and 
				Arunachal are perhaps older than all the Hindu style and Mughal 
				style paintings of Guru Nanak, yet all non-Sikhs (Hindus, 
				Muslims and Buddhists) in South Asia use his Sikh style 
				pictures, in recognition of his being the Founder of the Sikh 
				faith.&nbsp;</p>

				the wrong image.
				<p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">The way Guru Nanak&#39;s image was depicted 
				could have confused students about the appearance of the Sikhs 
				or Sikhs with other ethnic groups. After 9/11, many Sikhs were 
				assaulted and some non-Sikh students treated them with suspicion 
				thinking they were Muslims or had some link with Osama bin 
				Laden.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Curtis Washington, an African American 
				teacher became<span>&nbsp; </span>very emotional. Choking back 
				his tears, he supported the Sikhs saying, &quot;I can attest to the 
				pain of what a bad picture in a history book can do to a child.&quot; 
				Yvonne Chan, a Board Member<span>&nbsp; </span>praised the 
				performance of the Sikhs and sympathised with them.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Sikhs have no plan to rewrite history. 
				They wanted only to correct a mistake in the textbook. They are 
				happy with the outcome and are expecting early implementation of 
				the decision,&quot; Bindra said.</p>

						<p>The oldest pictures of Guru Nanak were painted by 
						Alam Chand, a bricklayer of Kapurthala, around 1733 CE, 
						i.e. about 200 years after Guru Nanak’s life-time 
						(1469-1539). The painter visualized Guru Nanak as a 
						Hindu and painted him as such. Please see Guru Nanak Dev 
						University’s publication <em>B-40 Janamsakhi Paintings</em> 
						(ISBN 81-7770-011-1) which has 57 plates. Plate 27 in 
						Susan Stronge’s <em>The Arts of the Sikh Kingdoms</em>, 
						1999 (ISBN 08348-0471-9) is from the said <em>Janamsakhi</em>. 
						Stronge’s book contains two other Hindu style images of 
						Guru Nanak, besides Mughal style images of Guru Nanak 
						(of c 1770-1830), Guru Har Rai (of 1815) and Guru Gobind 
						Singh (of 1850-60). </p>
						<p><strong>The question arises, how about Sikh style 
						portraits of the Sikh Gurus?</strong> Perhaps the first<strong> 
						Sikh style</strong> depictions of Guru Nanak appeared in 
						frescoes on walls of historic religious buildings. These 
						include Gurdwara Baba Atal Rai in the Golden Temple 
						Complex in Amritsar. First three floors of this Gurdwara 
						were completed by 1784. The ground floor has frescoes 
						showing Guru Nanak with uncut grey beard and a turban.<span>&nbsp;
						</span></p>
						<p>Sobha Singh painted Guru Nanak in a meditation pose (<em>Naam 
						Khumari Nanaka Charhi rahey din raat</em>) in 1937.<span>&nbsp;
						</span>Later he painted him in other poses, like “The 
						harbinger of monotheism” and the “Blessing pose”. In 
						1968, the SGPC commissioned him to paint a picture for 
						Guru Nanak’s 500<sup>th</sup> Birth Anniversary 
						celebrations.<span>&nbsp; </span>The SGPC distributed 
						its 100,000 copies in 1969. Since then, several other 
						painters have produced Sikh style paintings of Guru 
						Nanak, the Founder of the Sikh religion.</p>
						<p>The belief that the Sikh Gurus did not permit artists 
						to paint their portraits, and that authentic 
						contemporary portraits of Sikh Gurus do not exist, 
						appears to be baseless in view of the following based on 
						a report of<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"> 
						Singh (1):</span></p>
						<p>1.<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"> 
						Mohan Singh, a <span>&nbsp;</span>noted art scholar, found an 
						historic reference in “Gurbilas Patshahi 6” to a 
						painting of <strong>Guru Hargobind (6<sup>th</sup> Guru)</strong> 
						on horse back, to be in the possession of descendants of 
						Bidhi Chand at Sur Singh village in Amritsar. </span>
						</p>
						<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">
						2. Mohan Singh saw a painting of <strong>Guru Har Rai (7<sup>th</sup> 
						Guru)</strong> in the collection of Sodhi’s of Kartarpur. 
						The painting shows a beautifully-carved ivory stick with 
						a knob at its top, which is now in the possession of a 
						Brahman family residing in Thakurdwara street in 
						Amritsar. </span></p>
						<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">3
						</span>Singh (1) quotes Mohan Singh, “T<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">here 
						is a contemporary painting of <strong>Guru Gobind Singh 
						(10<sup>th</sup> Guru)</strong> at Harmandar Sahib, 
						Patna”, in which he is adorned with pearl necklaces, 
						armlets and a bejeweled ‘aigrette’ on his turban.</span></p>
						<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">
						4. Further, <span>&nbsp;</span>Khalsa (2) states that 
						historic publications<span>&nbsp; </span><em>Mahima 
						Parkash</em> and <em>Gur Partap Surya</em> and famous 
						scholar <em>Bhai</em> Kahn Singh Nabha and modern 
						writers (Harbans Singh , IAS and Kalraj Singh) tell the 
						story of a portrait of <strong>Guru Tegh Bahadur (9<sup>th</sup> 
						Guru) </strong>painted<strong> </strong>during his<span>&nbsp;
						</span>visit to Bengal. The Guru is reported to have 
						given the final strokes of the paint brush to help the 
						painter complete it. The painting is reported to be in 
						the Victoria Memorial Museum, Calcutta. </span></p>
						<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">
						5. Art historian Mohan Singh said, “No visual account of 
						the paintings, nor any literary evidence has come to 
						light as far as the first five Sikh gurus are 
						concerned”, (Singh, 1). However, recently, Khalsa (2) 
						has reported that Guru Nanak permitted the Caliph of 
						Baghdad to commission his portrait, as per <em>Tawarikh 
						guru Khalsa</em>. He adds that a European reported 
						seeing this portrait in the Baghdad museum in 1797. He 
						later published it in his book,” Oriental Collection.” 
						There are claims about the existence of photographs of 
						this painting in Punjab and California.</span><span style="COLOR: black">
						</span></p>
						<p><span style="COLOR: black">6. Further, I learn that 
						descendents of the founder of village Bhai Roopa, 
						District Bathinda have historical artifacts of the Guru 
						period, including a photo of Guru Nanak’s contemporary 
						painting made during his stay in Baghdad, Iraq (Personal 
						communication, Gurprit S. Hansra, April 5, 2007).</span></p>

								<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Sikh friends have 
								been asking me, “Why did the publisher choose a 
								late19th century image with a crown, and make 
								Guru Nanak look like a Muslim chieftain? What 
								made the publisher so sure that the late 19th 
								century image is more accurate than all other 
								commonly used pictures of Nanak?” Many say, 
								“This image belongs to a museum, not to a school 
								textbook, because it is historically incorrect.” 
								Others say, “No historian has recorded that Guru 
								Nanak ever wore a crown.”</span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Indeed, this is 
								perhaps the first time for this piece of museum 
								art &nbsp;to get into a book, and that too a school 
								textbook. It misinforms the non-Sikhs and would 
								confuse and offend the Sikh students. <strong>
								Accordingly, it is good that California’s State 
								Board of Education (SBE) decided against 
								continued use of&nbsp; this image in the current 
								and future prints of the book. </strong>A 
								picture is equal to thousand words<strong>.
								</strong>It is, hence, very desirable to have<strong>
								</strong>a replacement picture<strong>. </strong>
								That is why the publisher had the image.<strong>
								</strong>So the question has been asked,<strong> 
								“What did Guru Nanak look like?”</strong></span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Bhai Gurdas is 
								helpful in this connection. He was born in 1557,&nbsp; 
								within 20 years of Guru Nanak’s passing away in 
								1539. Guru Arjan&nbsp; employed him as a scribe 
								and he has been called the “Key to <em>Guru 
								Granth Sahib, </em>the Sikh Holy Book. He wrote 
								39 <em>Vars </em>(Poems)<em>. </em>&nbsp;In&nbsp; <em>
								Var I</em>, he wrote:”<em>Baba</em> Nanak then 
								proceeded to Kartarpur and put aside all the 
								garments of renunciation. He clad himself in 
								ordinary clothes, ascended the <em>gaddi </em>
								(throne) and thus preached <em>dharma</em>&nbsp; 
								to his people</span><span style="COLOR: #333333; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">.”<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
								</span></span><span>Based on this, many writers 
								have concluded that at the end of his travels, 
								during the last 18 years of his life, Guru Nanak 
								adopted the ordinary dress of a &quot;householder,&quot; 
								and dressed indistinguishably from the people 
								around him. {C.f.“The Sikhs” by Cole and Sambhi, 
								1978 and “The Book of Nanak”&nbsp; by Sarna}.</span><span style="COLOR: #333333; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								</span>.</span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Commenting on an 
								article entitled, “What did Guru Nanak look 
								like?” by Amardeep Singh, a Professor of Lehigh 
								University, Ms. Ruchira Paul of Houston, TX, 
								stated, “Absent any historical &quot;proof&quot;, the most 
								popular becomes the most &quot;accurate”. Images of 
								gods and godly men are not about historical 
								accuracy but have more to do with the comfort 
								level of the adherents of a faith.” She added, 
								“When a historical figure is elevated to the 
								stature of a spiritual figure in the minds of 
								followers, it matters little what he or she 
								&quot;really&quot; looked like in life. The pictorial 
								depictions of holy men and women assume an 
								allegorical value which has not much to do with 
								historical accuracy. The same goes with 
								religious relics. Whether a footprint belonged 
								to Ram, the hair is from Prophet Mohammed’s 
								beard or the Shroud of Turin indeed covered 
								Jesus&#39; dead body is not of essence. That 
								millions believe they did, is what matters.”&nbsp; 
								Referring to the image published in the 
								newspapers recently, she concluded, “Guru 
								Nanak&#39;s picture with the simple turban and tunic 
								is the most widely recognizable image to 
								millions of Sikhs and non-Sikhs.<strong> If it 
								is good enough for the devotees, it should be 
								good enough for the publisher</strong>.&quot; </span>
								</p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;Sobha Singh first 
								painted Guru Nanak’s imaginary portrait in 1937. 
								He painted the blessing pose for the Shiromani 
								Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), Amritsar 
								in 1969 for the quincentenary birthday 
								celebrations of Guru Nanak. The SGPC distributed 
								100,000 copies of this painting and now similar 
								paintings decorate most Sikh homes. </span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Although painted 
								&nbsp;about 430 years after Guru Nanak’s life-time, 
								it is the most popular<br />
								image of Guru Nanak, accepted worldwide by Sikhs 
								and non-Sikhs. Accordingly, the SGPC recommended 
								it to California’s Department of Education (CDE) 
								and State Board of Education&nbsp; (SBE), and 
								the Sikhs&nbsp; have been requesting that it be 
								used to replace the current Muslim style image 
								at the next printing. </span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Guru Nanak (1469 to 
								1539) founded the Sikh religion during the 
								period covered by the book under question (<em>An 
								Age of Voyages:1350-1600</em>). According to 
								March 8, 2007&nbsp; decision of California’s 
								State Board of Education, the future printings 
								of the book will have no picture relating to the 
								Sikh religion. However, the book will continue 
								to have pictures of&nbsp; leaders of Confucism 
								and Jainism, even though they belong to ancient 
								period and not to the medieval period covered by 
								the book. </span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It may be pointed out 
								that in North America, the population of Sikhs 
								(583,000) far exceeds that of Confucists (0) and 
								Jains (7,500).&nbsp;&nbsp; Worldwide also the 
								Sikhs (24,989,000) far outnumber the Confucists 
								(6,447,000) and Jains (4,519,000 {Figures are 
								from <em>The World Almanac and Book of Facts</em>
								<em>2006</em>}. In view of these figures, the 
								recommendation of the CDE to eliminate Guru 
								Nanak’s image (instead of its replacement with 
								one acceptable to the Sikhs) and its approval by 
								the SBE constitute actions contrary to the 
								spirit and requirements of the&nbsp; Education 
								Code 60044(a) and (b): “Portrayal of 
								contemporary U.S. society should reflect its 
								religious diversity,” and “legal compliance of 
								proportion of portrayal”.</span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Let us&nbsp; hope 
								that the&nbsp; authorities consider the 
								situation right away and decide that future 
								printings of the book shall contain a suitable 
								picture representing the Sikhs&nbsp; and that it 
								will be selected in consultation with a 
								representative of the Sikh community. </span>

																					<p><img title="Image" height="106" alt="Image" hspace="6" src="images/GURU%20NANAK2.jpg" width="78" border="0" />SACRAMENTO: Months after the California Sikhs had successfully got the State Board of Education to get removed from a Grade VII book an objectionable picture of Sikhism&#39;s founder Guru Nanak, which virtually showed him as a Muslim and was grossly offensive to all Sikhs, the publishers have now got printed new books omitting the picture altogether instead of replacing it with acceptable image of the Guru. </p>
																					<p>After the Sikhs tried to take the matter back to the Board, the latter has declined to act, thus leaving the students to miss the picture of Guru Nanak in &quot;An Age of Voyages: 1350-1600&quot;, a book which is otherwise lavishly illustrated. </p>
																					<p>The publisher Oxford University Press had earlier offered to replace the Islamic style picture of Guru Nanak with a Hindu style image, an offer which was spurned by the Sikhs.</p>
																					<p>&quot;(They had offered) to replace it with an image which portrayed Guru Nanak as a Hindu (with cap, tikka -vertical mark on the forehead, Janeyu - Hindu sacred thread and Dhoti –Hindu clothing). Naturally, I did not approve of the same. A letter signed by large numbers of Sikhs was sent to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and CDE for banning the book and replacement of offensive picture. Finally, the SBE scheduled a consideration of the matter at its meeting of March 7-8. I provided relevant material to the SBE members on March 7. These included&nbsp;&nbsp; copies of letters of Dr Narinder Singh Kapany, Noel Q. King, Professor Emeritus ( U.C. Santa Cruz) and the SGPC, written by them to CDE/SBE officers,&quot; Onkar S Bindra had explained.</p>
																					<p>It is not clear on what grounds a reputed publisher is digging in by refusing to publish an acceptable image which most Sikhs identify with.<br />
																					.<br />
																					Bindra had made a presentation, showing pictures of Guru Nanak in ten books on World Religions, written by non-Sikhs and published in USA or UK and one authored by non-Sikhs and published in India. All these had only Sikh style pictures of Guru Nanak. The board had finally voted in March ordering removal of the objectionable image of Guru Nanak which showed Guru Nanak wearing a crown and with a closely cropped beard on page 95. </p>
																					<p>Sikhism requires observant devouts not to shave their facial hair or any hair. </p>
																					<p>So far, some 520 copies have been distributed to 16 California school districts but are without any picture of the Guru. Sikh activists wanted that the offensive picture should have been replaced with a more accurate one, not removed entirely. </p>
																					<p>A media report quoted Jeff Brodd, a religious studies professor at Sacramento State University, as testifying at Thursday&#39;s hearing before the Board by saying that the book is &quot;wonderfully, lavishly illustrated,&quot; so the absence of an accurate picture of Guru Nanak is even more glaring. </p>
																					<p>Sikhs have also reported the problem with the titling of the Guru&#39;s name as the book uses the term &quot;devi&quot;, clearly a feminine form of address not used for men. The mistake somehow also points to rather shoddy handling of the affair by the publishers. </p>
																					<p>Surely, the Sikhs think, it wasn&#39;t difficult for scholars at the Oxford to realise that the prophet, a simple man who preached to the poor and certainly, couldnot worn a crown. The Oxford claimed they used the ealiest possible picture available, but the Sikhs proved even that fact to be inaccurate. Thomas Adams, director of the Curriculum Frameworks and Instructional Resources Division of the State Education Department, was quoted on this score in the media as saying that &quot;it wasn&#39;t defensible on the issue of accuracy, because it is from a later period&quot; than the one in which Guru Nanak lived. </p>
																					<p>Now efforts are on to correct the title. The publisher is likely to make available the new books to the school districts this summer.</p>
																					<p>California&#39;s school board has a public — and often lengthy — process of reviewing textbooks before they are made available for purchase by individual school districts. But it seems with the rise in cultural sensitivity, the cost and time consumed in making schoolbooks have also increased. </p>
																					<p>Publishers do usually make changes, though it is only because of California&#39;s size and buying power. The schoolbook market in the United States is roughly $4.2 billion and California schools are the nation&#39;s top purchaser. The state government allocated $403 million for schoolbooks in 2006, and that excludes federal money or lottery revenue. </p>
																					<p>Last time the row hit media headlines, the Sikhs had even presented six large transparencies of old murals in the old and historic Baba Atal Rai Gurdwara in the Golden Temple Complex, Amritsar, Punjab. Apparently, these murals are older than the offensive picture chosen by OUP. Besides, these are in the Sikh style. The painting which the SGPC recommended to the CDE/SBE bears strong resemblance with Guru Nanak in these old murals, especially regarding turban and unshorn facial hair.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
																					<p>A Sikh style picture of Guru Nanak would have most certainly helped correct the erroneous perception about Sikhs being Arabs, prevalent among large sections in the US. </p>

											2005, California Sikhs have pointed 
											out to the State Board of Education 
											that Sikh culture and Sikh 
											contributions to California history 
											are under-represented in the school 
											textbooks, leading many to mistake 
											Sikhs for what they are not. They 
											have suggested how to better 
											incorporate Sikhs into the 
											history-social science curriculum, 
											pointed out inaccuracies, and 
											submitted &quot;The Sikh Next Door&quot; 
											program and &quot;Meet the Sikhs&quot; DVD for 
											inclusion in the approved 
											Supplemental Instructional 
											Materials.</p>
											<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Meet the 
											Sikhs&quot; is a short video, produced in 
											2005 by the Public Broadcasting 
											station KVIE (TV Channels 6 &amp; 7, 
											Sacramento). It was telecast by the 
											KVIE numerous times. After a 
											successful Legal and Social review 
											in 2006, the video was included in 
											the list of approved Supplemental 
											Instructional Materials for 
											California&#39;s Public Schools. Dr. 
											David Hosley, the General Manager of 
											the KVIE, kindly agreed that the 
											video may be used for educational 
											purposes free of charge. </p>
											<p class="MsoNormal">Mr. Jack 
											O&#39;Connell, the Superintendent of 
											Public Instructions in California, 
											has taken a commendable step in 
											writing to County and District 
											Superintendents, at the request of 
											this reporter, to make use of the 
											video.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
											Superintendent wrote &quot;Members of the 
											Sikh community have testified to the 
											SBE that Sikhs have been targets of 
											hate crimes, especially in the 
											aftermath of the September 11, 2001 
											attacks, by Americans who mistakenly 
											identify them as Arab or Muslim.&quot; 
											Mentioning that the short video 
											&quot;Meet the Sikhs&quot; is available in 
											Quick Time format at 
											http://www.kvie.org/education/default.htm 
											free of charge, he stated, &quot;I 
											encourage you to make use of this 
											video to inform students about the 
											roles and contributions of Sikhs to 
											the history of California&quot;.</p>
											<p class="MsoNormal">Sikh parents 
											should personally see the Principals 
											of the schools of their children to 
											provide them one or two copies of 
											the DVD with a request that the DVD 
											may be shown to all their staff, 
											faculty and students.<span>&nbsp;
											</span>They could also offer their 
											services for a half-an-hour 
											presentation on Sikh culture, 
											history and religion to the 
											teachers. Sikh organizations, 
											Gurdwaras and Punjabi schools could 
											motivate the parents and choose 
											volunteer parents for contacting 
											each Principal.<span>&nbsp; </span>
											</p>
											<p class="MsoNormal"><em>In case of 
											problem in downloading the DVD, KVIE 
											{www.kvie.org<span>&nbsp; </span>
											Toll-free: 800-347-KVIE (5843)} 
											could help.<span>&nbsp; </span>For
