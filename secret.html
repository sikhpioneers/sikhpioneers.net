<p> 1. The Komagata Maru. - The following report gives some information about 
  attempts to smuggle arms and ammunition on board the Komagata Maru: </p>
<p>&quot;Several attempts have been made in Victoria, Vancouver, and a few adjacent 
  towns, to purchase wholesale supplies of small arms and ammunition, with the 
  object of furnishing them in those on board the Komagata Maru so that they should 
  be in a position to offer armed resistance to the Immigration officials and 
  the officers of the law. Subsequent events have clearly shown that the resistance 
  offered by these Hindus on the Komagata Maru is the result of a conspiracy, 
  the leaders of which are educated Indians resident in the United States. </p>
<p>About three weeks ago, two Hindu residents of Victoria, B.C., named respectively 
  Harnam Singh and Hookum Singh, made an attempt to purchase 25 automatic revolvers 
  and ammunition in that city. The hardware people refused to sell the arms and 
  ammunition, where-upon Harnam Singh stated to the salesman that they could easily 
  procure their wants at Port Angeles, Washington, where a countryman, named Taraknath 
  Das, had made arrangements to assist them in their purchases. On the 17th July 
  Harnam Singh took with him three other Hindus, named Bhag Singh, Balwant Singh 
  and Mewa Singh, and proceeded by electric train to Huntingdon, B.C., where they 
  interviewed the United States Immigration Inspector in charge, Mr. Jenkins, 
  and stated that they had come to meet some friends in Sumas and wished to have 
  an hour or two in their company. Unfortunately Mr. Jenkins was not aware of 
  the fact that Bhag Singh, Balwant Singh and Harnam Singh had been debarred from 
  entering the United States and granted their request. Some hours afterwards 
  the Provincial Police in Abotsford, a short distance from the United States 
  territory, arrested the Hindu named Mewa Singh. On searching him we found in 
  his possession two automatic revolvers and 500 rounds of ammunition, which he 
  said he had purchased in Sumas. This clue led to the discovery that Bhag Singh, 
  Balwant Singh and Harnam Singh were still in Sumas, and our Immigration Officer 
  at Huntingdon was instructed to refuse them entry into Canada on their return. 
  Inspector Jenkins, to whom the information was communicated, soon traced these 
  three men and found that they had been in conference with Taraknath Das. It 
  was also found that besides Taraknath Das, there were three other Hindus from 
  the United States who were implicated, one of these being Bhagwan Singh. On 
  Inspector Jenkins talking these three men into custody, it was discovered that 
  they were each armed with automatic revolvers and ammunition&quot;. </p>
<p> Balwant Singh was a member of the recent deputation from the Sikhs in Canada 
  to His Excellency the Viceroy. Bhag Singh and Harnam Singh are well known to 
  us as leaders of the seditious movement in British Columbia. Bhagwan Singh, 
  who was deported from Canada for preaching sedition and Taraknath Das, Har Dayal's 
  lieutenant, are too well known to need description. </p>
<p> There is reason to believe that the attempts to smuggle arms on board were 
  not altogether unsuccessful, as it is reported that during the fight with the 
  police in Vancouver harbor two or three shots were fired from the ship. <br>
  <br>
  It is known in the Punjab that the Komagata Maru is on her way to India. A correspondent 
  writes that he heard in Lahore that the ship had reached Colombo and that the 
  passengers had several revolvers and bombs on board. </p>
<p> The latest news of the Komagata Maru is that she is coming straight to Calcutta 
  from Singapore and not vi&acirc; Colombo. Arrangements to meet her at Calcutta 
  have been concerted between the Bengal and Punjab Governments and this Department. 
</p>
<p> 2. The following account of the fight between the police and the passengers 
  on board the Komagata Maru has been sent from Panama to several persons in Karachi:</p>
<p> &quot;Scores of policemen injured in a hit battle with Hindus on board a Japanese 
  steamer. </p>
<p>Vancouver, B.C., July 22nd. - Scores among a party of 175 policemen and constables 
  were injured, several seriously, the other day in a battle with several hundred 
  infuriated Hindus on board the Japanese steamer Komagata Maru in the harbor 
  here. Showers of coal, clubs, iron bars, hatchets and other missiles rained 
  from the ship on the official force which attempted to board the steamer. </p>
<p>The Hindus braved the steam from a big hose which the tug turned on them and 
  mercilessly pelted the men on the decks of the tug with lumps of coal. Fire 
  bricks and pieces of iron from what is believed to have been the wreckage of 
  the engine room followed. No shots were fired on either side. The Hindus had 
  no firearms, and the police refrained from using theirs. </p>
<p>The battle grew out of an attempt to rid the harbor of the Japanese steamer 
  on which 350 Hindus came to this port three months ago, only to have the Canadian 
  Immigration officials refuse them admission to the country. Their claim of a 
  right to land as British subjects was overruled by the Courts, and the steamer 
  was ordered to sail with them on board. The Hindus had been rebellious, and 
  several times attempted, to land but were prevented. </p>
<p>As the steamer was without provisions, the Canadian authorities a day or two 
  ago decided to put sufficient stores on board for the voyage to the Orient whence 
  the Komagata Maru came. Plans were carefully matured and early on Sunday the 
  tug Sea Lion put out with the provisions and what was deemed to be a sufficient 
  boarding force to overcome any opposition. The 125 city policemen had revolvers 
  and the special constables rifles. The Sea Lion slowly steamed out to the Japanese 
  vessel. When within hailing distances of her, it was seen that every inch of 
  space along the rail and on the deck and bridge was occupied by Hindus armed 
  each with a club or other weapon, while at the bow of the steamer a solid mass 
  of humanity was congregated. </p>
<p>The Tug's hose was made ready, and back and forth along the rows of Hindus 
  a steam was played. That form of attack was effective momentarily, and the Hindus 
  retreated under the rush of water propelled at high pressure. It looked for 
  the time as if the boarder would carry through their program without serious 
  trouble. The situation quickly changed, however. Pluckily rallying, several 
  Hindus faced the stream and began dashing a shower of missiles upon the attacking 
  party. This was only a foretaste. Reinforcement in the ship followed up the 
  defensive move and soon a tremendous storm of lumps of coal was being rained 
  upon the party on the top deck, which was at the mercy of the Hindus above as 
  they had orders to use fore arms. </p>
<p>As the shower of missiles continued, thick and fast, many men were felled by 
  blows on the head. Soon the police had enough and the Sea Lion withdrew. </p>
<p>True copy of one of the esteemed papers of Germany. We Indians are in the dark.&quot;</p>
<p> 3. Circulation of the &quot;Khalsa Akhbar&quot; in Vancouver. - Information 
  has been received that Harchand Singh, the Sikh agitator of Lyallpur, used to 
  send a copy of his newspaper, the Khalsa Akhbar, to the Sikh temple at Vancouver 
  every week. This newspaper which during its short career made itself notorious 
  for its hostility to Government and to the Chief Khalsa Diwan, particularly 
  in connection with the Rikabganj Gurdwara agitation, was much appreciated by 
  the Sikhs in Vancouver. It was circulated from hand to hand eventually returning 
  to the priest of the temple. </p>
<p> 4. Ram Chand Peshawari. - The Paisa Akhbar of Lahore, dated the 19th September, 
  published a communication from California, in which it is stated that large 
  meetings were held at six different places in America at which Sikh and Mohammedan 
  preachers delivered spirited and learned lectures on the condition of Indians 
  in foreign countries, particularly Canada, the United States and Africa. Pandit 
  Ram Chand, it is said, delivered exciting speeches on national progress and 
  national movements. Appeals were made for a National Scientific Educational 
  Fund and a sum of 20,000 dollars was collected. Pandit Ram Chand is, of course, 
  Ram Chand Peshwari, at present editor of the Ghadr. <br>
