POEMS: The Soul Of The Gadar Movement.
<p>
<b>Introduction</b>
	<br>The following three poems are written by gadarites.  The original
poems were written in Punjabi but have been translated into English by
Isemonger & Slattery.  <a href="famous.html#kartar">Kartar Singh  Sarabha</a> wrote the first poem.  He sang
it when he was led to his execution.  The second four-line poem was
written by Pandit Jagat Ram.  It was recited by prisoners as a farewell
poem for Sarabha.  The third poem is also by Sarabha and it became popular
among the gadarites.  These three poems can be called the soul of the
Gadar Movement, as they depict the depth of their conviction and
dedication.

<b><i>ON THE WAY TO THE GALLOWS</i> (1)</b>
<br>
<b><i>By: Kartar Singh Sarabha</i></b>
<br>
<br>On the judgment day
<br>Before the gods
<br>These will be my words, my statement:
<br>I am a servant of Indians
<br>India belongs to me
<br>Yes, Indian I am
<br>One hundred percent Indian
<br>Indian is my blood and my caste
<br>This is my only religion
<br>My only tribe, my only clan
<br>I am a particle of the ravaged India's ruins
<br>This is the only name I have
<br>The only hallmark, the only address
<br>Oh, Mother India this was not be my fate
<br>My good fortune
<br>That with every movement of mine
<br>I could have worshipped your feet
<br>O Mother India
<br>If my head is offered
<br>My life is sacrificed
<br>In your service
<br>Then, I would understand
<br>Even in my death
<br>I will attain
<br>A life of eternity.

<b><i>FAREWELL POEM FOR SARABHA (2)</i></b>
<p></p>
<i>By: Pandit Jagat Ram</i>
<p></p>
India is so proud of you, O Kartar,<br>
That you are marching on the path of sacrifice<br>
Along with you<br>
You are talking Jagat and Pingle<br>
Dear friends, every Indian today<br>
Swears to your blood<br>
That we will complete your mission.
<p></p>


<b><i>WHO WE ARE (3)</i></b>
<p></p>
<b><i>By: Kartar Singh Sarabha</i></b>
<p></p>
If anyone asks who we are<br>
Tell him our name is rebel<br>
Our duty is to end the tyranny<br>
Our profession is to launch revolution<br>
That is our namaz, this is our sandhya<br>
Our puja, our worship<br>
This is our religion<br>
Our work<br>
This is our only Khuda, our only Rama.<br>
