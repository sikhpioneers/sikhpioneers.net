      Meeting</FONT></H2><BR><B><I>Prof. Onkar S. Bindra </I></B><BR><FONT

      <P>California Sikhs have been unhappy over the fact that the K-8 textbooks 
      for History-Social Science in current use have nothing about Sikh 
      identity, culture, or history of their immigration. They consider this to 
      be the leading reason for ignorance of the masses about the Sikhs. 
      <P>In July this year it was found that even the new books submitted by 
      publishers to the California Department of Education (CDE) did not contain 
      information on Sikhs. Realizing that the next chance to get Sikh 
      information included will be only after six years, the writer attended 
      meetings of the (1) Subject Matter Committee on Sept. 29, (2) Curriculum 
      Commission Meeting on Sept. 30, and (3) Ad-Hoc Committee Meeting on 
      October 31. At each of these meeting he pointed out that the Framework 
      Content Standards require a multicultural perspective throughout K-8, and 
      require material to create awareness about different people of the State 
      in Grade one, and information on immigration history in Grade four books. 
      <P>He added that the Standards of Evaluation required proportionate 
      portrayal. Pointing out that most books did not include images of Sikh 
      children and their parents in books for Grade one, or history of Sikh 
      immigration in Grade 4, he pleaded that such books not be recommended 
      until these are improved by adding Sikh information. Unfortunately, the 
      C.D.E. bound by deadlines for replacing old books with new ones, 
      recommended books of 10 out of 12 publishers who had submitted the new 
      books. 
      <P>In the light of the above, the Sikh community statewide was requested 
      to plead to the State Board of Education (SBE) to postpone approval of 
      books proposed by publishers and recommended by the CDE, to give 
      publishers time to included Sikh information. A meeting was held at Yuba 
      City on November 6 to coordinate the efforts. A dozen concerned Sikhs 
      attended it on the day of the Nagar Keertan in which some 60,000 
      participated. They decided to make a strong representation to the SBE at 
      the forthcoming 2005 History-Social Science Primary Adoption. Accordingly, 
      20 Sikhs, from San Jose to Yuba City in Northern California, went to the 
      meeting of the SBE on Nov. 9 . 
      <P>Besides the writer, the following twelve spoke during the Public 
      Comments Session. <BR>· Dr. Siri Pritam Kaur Khalsa - President Punjabi 
      American Heritage Society, Yuba City.<BR>· Mr. Gurpal Singh Khaira - 
      Managing Director, Guru Nanak Mercy Foundation <BR>· Dr. Amrik Singh, 
      Teacher Elk Grove School District <BR>· Dr. Narinder S. Parhar - President 
      of SIKHS (Sikh Information &amp; Khalsa Heritage Society) <BR>· Mr. 
      Sukhdev S. Bainiwal - Bay area citizen <BR>· Mr. Paramjit S. Gahra - 
      Lawyer citizen, Bay Area <BR>· Dr. J.P. Singh – President of El Sobrante 
      Gurudwara <BR>· Mrs. Sarabjit Kaur Cheema - Union City Teacher <BR>· Mr. 
      Gurmeet Singh Khalsa - President of Fremont Gurudwara <BR>· Dr. Anahat K. 
      Sandhu - Vice-President, World Sikh Council, American Region <BR>· Dr. 
      Amarjit S. Bal - Stockton citizen <BR>· Mr Inderjit S. Kallirai - 
      Indo-American Cultural Heritage Society <BR>
      <P>In a joint statement, on behalf of the entire Sikh community, the 
      writer stated as follows: <BR>
      <P>1. Of the 24.085 million Sikhs worldwide, 583,000 live in North 
      America. The 200,000 California Sikhs, who worship in some 50 Gurudwaras, 
      end their prayers seeking welfare of all humanity. They are significant in 
      the socioeconomic fabric of the State. <BR>
      <P>2. Whereas the Framework Content Standards require a MULTICULTURAL 
      PERSPECTIVE throughout K-8, and REQUIRE material to create AWARENESS about 
      different people of the State in Grade one, and the Standards of 
      Evaluation require PROPORTIONATE PORTRAYAL, most books do not include 
      images of Sikh children and their parents in books for Grade one. <BR>
      <P>In the absence of such pictures in school textbooks, students will not 
      know that almost all who wear turbans in America are Sikhs, for whom use 
      of tobacco is taboo. They will continue to fear from ignorance and may 
      show prejudice against turbaned Sikhs, even the white (caucasian) American 
      Sikhs community. The Sikhs will continue to be prime victims of hate 
      crimes that have increased greatly in the wake of 9/11. The poster "Common 
      Sikh American Head Coverings" issued by the U.S. Department of Justice in 
      2004 should be reflected in the textbooks. <BR>
      <P>3. Sikhs immigration to California started 106 years ago. The Sikh 
      Temple Stockton, dedicated in 1915, has been declared a State Monument. 
      <BR>
      <P>4. Pioneer Sikh immigrants worked on railroads and in lumberyards and 
      many went into farming. They faced discriminatory laws and intolerance 
      from European immigrants. Two Sikh students of Berkeley deserve mention. 
      Dr. Bhagat Singh Thind left studies to serve in the army during World War 
      I, but when he applied for citizenship after his honorable discharge, the 
      Supreme Court denied it. Citizenship of others was rescinded in the wake 
      of this decision. Later, he earned a Ph.D. and became a great spiritual 
      scientist. <BR>
      <P>Likewise, Dalip Singh Saund, who earned a Ph.D. from Berkeley, had to 
      go into farming because he could not get a job. When elected Judge for the 
      first time, he was not allowed to serve because he had not completed one 
      year as a citizen. On his re-election, he did serve as a Judge. In 1956, 
      he was elected to the U.S. Congress. He was the first Asian to serve as 
      Congressman and served three terms. In recognition of his services for 
      Civil Rights, an U.S. Post Office in Temecula has been dedicated to him. 
      <BR>
      <P>The writer had earlier submitted to members of the SBE copies of "Sikhs 
      in Northern California"; a short DVD produced by KVIE, the local PBS 
      station. The video clip correctly points out that History of Sikh 
      immigration has not yet found place in school textbooks. The writer said, 
      "The 4th grade textbooks should have history of immigration, and stories 
      of Dr. Bhagat Singh and Dr. Dalip Singh Saund, Congressman, in compliance 
      of the Content Standards." <BR>
      <P>Ending his presentation the writer said, "Since textbook approval takes 
      place only every six years, and previously approved textbooks are 
      available, we urge you to approve the books only after publishers have 
      included pictures of Sikh children, parents and grandparents with their 
      head coverings and other relevant information." <BR>
      <P>Dr. Narinder Singh Parhar and Gurpal Singh Khaira mentioned the unique 
      features of the Sikh scriptures, Sikh religion and ethics, especially 
      standing for religious freedom of even non-Sikhs, citing the martyrdom of 
      Guru Tegh Bahadur as an example. <BR>
      <P>Paramjit Singh Gahra said, "One of the biggest boons of the Sikh 
      tradition is that tobacco is a taboo". He asked, "Wouldn't this knowledge 
      about Sikhs have a positive effect, as young children do start smoking 
      early in schools?” <BR>
      <P>Dr Anahat Kaur Sandhu, Vice-President of World Sikh Council-American 
      Region, emphasized the role Sikhs play in the building of California and 
      recommended that teachers utilize the available resource material and 
      presented to the SBE a copy of the book Religion in Ohio.<BR>
      <P>Inderjit Singh Kallirai talked at length about the importance of Sikhs 
      in our daily life. He said, "If you travel along Highway 5 from Bellingham 
      in the North to San Diego in the South, I can assure you that one of my 
      fellow Sikhs and/or Indo-Americans can provide you services, assistance 
      and support along your journey: From Gas to a Sandwich, from treating you 
      when sick to providing you a warm and safe bed when you are tired; From 
      Fresh Peaches to Raisins, From repairing your automobile should it 
      breakdown to that convenient refreshment. Not only that, if you use a 
      computer or a Laptop, then the Pentium chip was designed by an 
      Indo-American the Hotmail service by another Indo-American Sikh, and the 
      World Wide Web's backbone - Fiber optics by another Indo-American Sikh." 
      <BR>
      <P>Sukhdev Singh Bainiwal, Sarabjit Kaur Cheema and Gurmeet Singh Khalsa 
      (all from Fremont) related woeful stories of the verbal and physical abuse 
      suffered by their kids at school. <BR>
      <P>Krishna Kaur Khalsa, in her written submittal, stated, "Being a white 
      American born Sikh doesn’t shelter one from ridicule and harassment. My 
      husband has been called Osama Bin Laden and Rag Head by mistaken youth of 
      Placerville, where we live." <BR>
      <P>Siri Pritam Kaur Khalsa said, "only education can change attitudes 
      towards those that look or dress different. It is important that Sikh 
      children be able to see themselves in the books and that all American 
      children learn about the contributions Sikhs have made to American 
      society." <BR>
      <P>Talking of the murder of innocent Mr Balbir Singh Sodhi in a hate crime 
      in Arizona and killing of his brother in San Francisco in the wake of 
      9/11, Dr. Amrik Singh of Elk Grove became very emotional. <BR>
      <P>Dr JP Singh who has conducted Arab Muslim Sikh Cultural Awareness 
      Training of Law Enforcement Officials, for the US Department of Justice 
      Community Relations Service, to minimize the mistaken identity hate crime 
      killings, reported that 85% of the Law Enforcement personnel did not know 
      who Sikhs were. He pleaded for inclusion of US DOJ Poster type Sikh images 
      in the First Grade Social Studies Books. He added, "It is my belief that 
      images registered in a child’s mind at that age will go a long way in 
      helping them in understanding the communities they live in and someday may 
      even deter them from committing mistaken identity related hate 
crimes."<BR>
      <P>Dr Amarjit Singh Bal and his wife (a retired teacher), in a joint 
      statement, stated, "The lack of information about Sikh Americans in the 
      textbooks used in the public schools continues to keep the populace 
      ignorant about Sikh Americans. The lack of understanding and appreciation 
      among children and adults has perpetuated prejudice against Sikh 
      Americans. The pre-existing ethnic prejudice against Sikh Americans 
      further intensified after 9/11 because of mistaken identity. Sikh children 
      and adults have been victims of hate crimes. I view the adoption of 2005 
      textbooks for California public schools as a great opportunity to advance 
      the cause of equal treatment of all people who inhabit this great State.” 
      <BR>
      <P>Representatives of the SBE, CDE and the Publishers have told this 
      writer that the Sikh feedback was very informative and educative and made 
      a deep impression on them. I believe that We have made some progress. The 
      speakers are determined to continue our efforts to get information on 
      Sikhs included in textbooks of all publishers with their cooperation and 
      that of the CDE/SBE. We want to be involved in the revision of the 
      History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools. We want to 
      ensure inclusion of History of Medieval India in Grade 7 and of Sikhism, 
      the 5th largest world religion, in the elective course “Survey of World 
      Religions”. <BR>
