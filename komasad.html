<P>(This account by Mrs. Anna Ross was published in a Toronto journal soon after 
  the return of “Komagata Maru” from Canadian shores. Apart from being a very 
  cogent summary of the entire scene, it voiced the concern of the right-thinking 
  Canadians. Ed) </P>
<P></P>
The story of the “Komagata Maru” and her passengers must be very briefly given. 
The bar that has for several years excluded Hindus from Canada has been the rule 
that only those could be admitted to our shores who came by one continuous route. 
As there was no continuous route the Hindus were kept out. But in 1914, 350 of 
these Sikhs clubbed together and made a continuous passage by chartering a ship 
for themselves, and in May 1914, they entered Vancouver Harbour, expecting, as 
they confirmed to the Canadian rule, they would be admitted at least for inspection, 
and that those who were found eligible would be passed. 
<P></P>
One would think that the decent way for the authorities to act towards these men 
who had so accommodated themselves to the Canadian rule, would be to receive them 
politely, and to deal with each case fairly and squarely according to law, passing 
those eligible, and rejecting non- eligibles. Then, if the will of the Canadian 
people was still for shutting the door, to do so by straight statute, — “No Hindu 
Need Apply”. After that there would at least be no misunderstanding or disappointments. 
<P></P>
But these men who had accommodated themselves to the Canadian rule, who at a cost 
to themselves of nearly $57,000 had come by one continuous route, who now politely 
asked admission as British subjects and expected it, received instead indignity 
after indignity. It is almost inconceivable the lengths to which the official 
insolence went in the treatment of these strong, proud, independent men. They 
were not allowed to communicate with the Sikhs on shore at all. They were not 
allowed to communicate with their own lawyer. Even when their case for admission 
was in court, their lawyer, Mr. Bird, was not allowed a personal interview with 
any of them, so that he was conducting their case in the dark. After the case 
was decided under these circumstances against them, Mr. Bird was allowed to visit 
them, and discovered that very important elements in the case he had not understood 
at all, and had presented. If this is Canadian justice, it is not British justice. 
<P></P>
When the case had been decided against them, they expressed their willingness 
to leave, only requesting that they should be supplied with provisions for the 
return voyage. The immigration authorities refused provision, but tried to compel 
the captain of the ship to sail at once. Though they had been unnecessarily delayed 
by the authorities for six weeks, these officials endeavoured to force them to 
commence their long voyage without provisions. This roused the man and the soldier 
in these Sikhs, and they prevented the captain from obeying. One hundred and seventy-five 
policemen and the stream from a fire-hose only roused them more. They beat back 
the policemen with fire-bricks and lumps of coal. Then in the dignity of her might, 
Canada ordered the cruiser “Rainbow” to proceed alongside the “Komagata Maru” 
and compel submission. By this time the inhuman attempt to send 350 men across 
the Pacific starving had been abandoned, and offers of abundant provisions were 
made. But by this time the fighting blood of the Sikhs was up. They knew they 
had been barbarously treated by representatives of the Canadian Government, and 
they were resolved to put no trust in any offer now made to them, but to fight 
and die if need be. 
<P></P>
That was the position Canada found herself on July 22nd, 1914. The guns of the 
“Rainbow” were trained on the little “Komagata Maru”. The Sikhs on board had used 
timber to construct barricades, and the blacksmiths among them were working at 
fever heat making swords and pikes. The government then in extremity sought the 
good offices of the Sikhs on shore, and though they had refused to allow them 
any intercourse with the men on the “Komagata Maru” before, they were now glad 
to have a deputation of shore Sikhs endeavour to convince them that the Government 
this time was really acting in good faith, to accept the offers of provisions 
and leave. They were finally successful, and the little ship sailed away. 
<P></P>
It is a sad story. They could at least have been treated courteously and given 
a chance to plead their own case fairly, even if the law had refused them admission 
in the end. But most Canadians know little about these things.
