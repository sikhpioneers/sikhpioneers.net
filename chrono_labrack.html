	<I>The pattern of immigration from South Asian countries has changed

since 1965.  For example, where once Sikh immigration predominated from

India before that year, immigration from other parts of India became more

widespread and settlement more diverse to countries of destination.  As Dr.

Labrack <a href="#footnote">(1)</a>

observed in his work, <B>&quot;South Asians&quot;</B>, in <B>Our Cultural Heritage: A Guide to America's Principal Ethnic Groups</B>. Greenwood Press, 1997, pp. (with permission)-- </I> 

<P>

	After 1965 the preeminence of California as the center of South

Asian American Life declined, becoming only one of the eight popular

 destinations.  By the 1990's eight major industrial-urban states located

 in the East (New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey), Southwest (Texas),

 mid-West (Michigan, Illinois, Ohio), and West (California) accounted for

 70% of the U.S. South Asian population.  This obviously reflects a

 distribution of the nation's industrial, university, service, and

 high-tech sectors of the economy in which engineers, scientists,

 academics, doctors and nurses would find employment.  Within states there

 are preferred cities such as New York, Chicago, San Jose, Los Angeles/Long

 Beach, Washington, DC., and Houston.

<P> 

	Overall, statistically the new immigrants appear intellectually,

 financially, and socially-accomplished.  A profile of those born in India

 shows a relatively young, upwardly mobile population.  Perhaps most

 dramatic when compared to the early immigrants, the socio-economic and

 educational portraits of India-born U.S. South Asians are a complete

 reversal of circumstances of their predecessor's first half-century.

<P>

	In the 1990 census they were shown to have the highest median

household income, family income, per capita income, and annual median

income ($40,625) of any foreign-born group.  They also ranked first in

holding stocks and IRA's, in rates of educational achievement, and in the

attainment of managerial or professional positions in a 1991 survey of

five Asian American groups.  

<P>

	Many of America's major educational institutions, health care

 facilities, or research laboratories have South Asians as part of their

 staffs.  

 <P>

 	Doctors of South Asian descent are represented in numbers out of

 all proportion to the size of their population cohort and are emblematic

 of the high educational level which symbolizes the South Asian

professional immigrant of the past thirty years.  As early as 1980, of the

 some 400,000 South Asians in America, 11% of the men and 8% of the women

were physicians, another 7% of the women were nurses.  Married South Asian

couples who are both physicians are quite common.  Moreover, 17% of the

remaining males were either engineers, architects, or surveyors.  By

  mid-1997 it is estimated perhaps 4% (22,000) of the entire nation's

  medical doctors are South Asian immigrants from India or of South Asian

  descent.  It has been claimed that many inner city public hospitals

  simply could not function if South Asian medical personnel were

  unavailable as they can constitute as high as 40% of the staff

  physicians and 50% of the nurses.  In Ohio, one out of six

physicians is South Asian and several other states approach that ratio.

<P>

 	However, this favorable overall picture of South Asian

 achievement is somewhat misleading.  The major gains and benefits have

 been enjoyed mostly by South Asian immigrants who established themselves

 prior to the 1980's or those trained in medicine or cutting-edge

 technologies which are in high demand, such as computer engineering and

 software, lasers, or physics. For those entering after around 1985, the

 picture is one of declining median income, fewer professional/managerial

 positions, a much higher unemployment rate, higher rates of business

 failures, and higher rates of families in poverty.  India-born immigrants ranked 12th in a national survey of individuals and families in poverty in

 1993 and a regional Pacific Rim States study in 1995 claimed that

 California and the highest percentage (14%) of Indian American children

 living in poverty.

 	Although no firm, reliable national statistics are available on

 the numbers or proportions of South Asian linguistic diversity in

 America,

 there are some estimates from regions with high concentrations of

 immigrants such as New York and Los Angeles.  In 1980 the

 percentages for New York were given as 34% Gujurati, 20% Hindi, and 24%

 combined Dravidian languages (Tamil, Kannada, Malallyalam, Telegu).

 Distribution in Southern California in the same period was estimated

 at 20% each for Punjabi and  Gujurati, Urdu 18%, Hindi 16%, Dravidian languages 12%, and

 Bengali 11%. It is certain that these have already changed somewhat

 (Gujurati likely  having gained overall) and will continue to do so as

 the  combination of  new immigration and internal population shifts 

  rearrange the mix of  languages, religions, settlement patterns

  , and destinations across  America.
