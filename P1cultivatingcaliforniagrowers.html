<p>Sikhs, immigrants from the Punjab region of northwest India , constituted the labor that “blew itself” into Davisville orchards in the summer of 1908. Religious and political reformers opposed to the caste system and other practices they considered corrupt, Sikhs began immigrating to the Pacific Coast earlier in the decade to escape poverty and British colonialism. Deemed undesirable by the residents of British Columbia , they had filtered down into northern California by 1907, where they found work on the railroads or in lumber mills. Because most Sikhs came from agricultural backgrounds, they gravitated toward the opportunities for orchard work the 1908 bumper crop presented. The popular press labeled them “outcasts,” as virtually all of them were males with long hair, beards, and white turbans. For growers such as Pierce, however, they proved indispensable as harvest workers. </p>
<p>In the spring of 1907, four Sikhs had presented themselves to Pierce and offered their services as farmhands. Attracted by their willingness to work for $1.25 a day and by their strong, robust physiques, Pierce hired them to dig irrigation ditches, saw and stack wood, shovel and haul manure, and perform various other mundane chores. Their wages compared favorably with those for other forms of day labor during the recession and greatly exceeded the 10 to 15 cents a day typically earned in India . Two of them, Mousha Singh and Bogosin Singh, returned the following winter. Gradually gaining Pierce's confidence, they began performing tasks demanding more skill, such as pruning, irrigating, and harrowing. The Sikhs found much of this work familiar, as agricultural conditions in the Sacramento Valley closely resembled those of the Punjab . With the huge almond harvest approaching, Pierce rejected a Japanese contractor's offer and asked Mousha and Bogosin to recruit a gang of Sikh harvesters – or “Hindoos,” as he and other growers called them, oblivious to the fact that these were committed dissenters from Hinduism. </p>
<p>They did not disappoint him. The two Sikhs linked Pierce to a network of “chain employment” that provided him with a ready source of harvest labor. In early August, Mousha and Bogosin contracted Shaam Singh, a contractor based in nearby Vacaville , who recruited 30 workers, for the month long harvest at $1.25 a day. With Mousha, Bogosin, Shaam, and one of his white permanent ranch hands as gang bosses, Pierce oversaw the operation of four sleds with as many as six workers per sled knocking almonds. He then resumed his position at the almond huller with the assistance of six additional Sikhs in the packing sheds. He also implemented a new wage strategy that assured greater obedience within his harvest labor force. Where as he previously had advance Chinese and Japanese contractors irregular amounts of cash to cover their labor, board, and other immediate costs, he now provided board for his workers, deducted that expense from their total wages, and paid a final settlement to the contractor at the conclusion of the harvest. This strategy shifted the burden of securing a worker's loyalty from Pierce to the contractor. Now, if a harvester quit early, the contractor was responsible for that harvester's costs and lost labor. Mousha, Bogosin, and Shaam restored Pierce's sense of paternalism in providing an abundance of skillful, compliant workers to harvest his most profitable crop of almonds to date. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Pierce acted to maintain this arrangement, with Mousha becoming the linchpin for its success. Pierce hired him as one of his permanent field workers, and then depended on Moucha's ties to the Sikh community in northern California to procure an adequate labor force for the almond season. In 1909, a below-average year, Mousha himself assumed the role of contractor, recruiting 10 workers, probably from the large Sikh community in Yuba City, 50 miles north of Davis. By the following year, the positive reputation Mousha had built for the Pierce orchards began to pay dividends. Fifteen unrecruited Sikhs arrived in Davis in early August seeking work as almond harvesters, and Mousha secured another 15 who had applied for work at the Murray and Ready Employment Agency in Sacramento. A similar pattern of harvest employment continued through 1916, as Sikh laborers – either on their own, through private employment agencies, or through a contractor – journeyed to the Pierce ranch every August expecting to find work. Pierce rewarded his workers' loyalty and further enhanced his favorable reputation by raising their wages (to $1.75) in 1910 and $2.00 in 1913), by building them a bunkhouse and kitchen, and by procuring them further employment with his neighbor almond growers. His own faith in Mousha – epitomized by Mousha's sharing the duty of operating the almond huller in 1913 – became the focal point for the entire harvest process. </p>
<p>In December 1913, Mousha unexpectedly quit his job on the Pierce ranch and returned to India, perhaps to participate in a rebellion against the British in his homeland. The Sikh referral network he had established, however, remained in place, now managed by three of his contacts, Indar Singh, Kalla Singh, and Anokh Singh. From 1914 to 1916, Indar and Kalla worked as permanent employees for Pierce, served as gang bosses during the almond harvest, and acted as Pierce's liaison to Anokh, a labor contractor based in Isleton in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Every Christmas, Anokh sent Pierce a crate of celery, a display of allegiance symbolizing the mutual accord underlying this arrangement. Labor relations on the Pierce ranch appeared to have stabilized. Just one year later, however, in 1917, “Hindu insubordination” – as Pierce described it – would disrupt that harmony once again. </p>
<p>Pierces preference for Sikh over Japanese workers stemmed from more than personal experience alone. Between 1905 and 1913, the “Japanese question” dominated California politics. </p>
<p>In Placer County, the vast majority of growers left the harvest in the hands of their tenants. On rare occasions, Asian renters were fined for violating the standardization law. But they were far better known for, as Butler put it, their “skillful and scientific picking and packing.” The fact that significant numbers of Japanese farm workers from Fresno now found Newcastle more to their liking kept the supply of harvest labor plentiful. Rumblings of a labor shortage could be heard in Davis, however. No one knew better than Pierce that “skyrocketing production” increased competition for harvesters. When he had not heard from his trustworthy contractor, Anokh Singh, five days before the 1916 harvest, Pierce anxiously drove 30 miles to Isleton, where he found his contractor at work for an asparagus company. Pierce convinced Anokh to bring his gang to Davis, but only after raising wages from $1.75 to $2.00. Jacob E. La Rue, J. W. Anderson, and several other neighbors who also counted on Anokh's services breathed a collective sigh of relief. </p>
<p>Anticipating his largest almond harvest to date, Pierce once again drove to Isleton in mid-July looking for Anokh Singh. “Does not look encouraging,” he wrote in his daily journal after their discussion. Though Pierce did not realize it at the time, Anokh had decided to take his crew to Fresno. He simply could not pass up what he had heard over the Singh grapevine – that raisin pickers could make as much as $7.00 to $12.00 a day. Pierce turned to his “permanent” hands Indar Singh and Kalla Singh, but through mid-August, neither managed to procure enough harvesters at the $2.00 wage their employer offered. With his almonds “ripe and ready,” Pierce heeded the advice circulated by the Council of Defense. On August 19, he applied for help at the “State Employment Office” that Farm Labor Agent Richard L. Adams had just opened in Sacramento. The office supplied with 30 Sikh workers at a set rate of 30 cents an hour, 11 hours a day. But after just one week of knocking almonds, Pierce's new harvesters fully aware of their optimal bargaining position, demanded an extra nickel an hour – which Pierce in his own words, “had to pay.” </p>
<p>Even with the high wage (now almost double that of the previous year), it was the Sikh workers who bore the brunt of the wartime inflation, rather than their employer. In 1916, the laborer who worked every day of Pierce's harvest earned $42. In 1917, despite the wage increase, he netted just $45. The reason lay in the worker's expenses: a sack of clour purchased at the Davis grocery, for example, cost 40 cents in 1916, but $3.35 in 1917. And while Pierce's labor costs doubled between the two harvests, his real almond income increased substantially, though not enough to satisfy him. Indeed, what Pierce termed “Hindu insubordination” bruised his paternal ego as much as inflation robbed his pocketbook – a transgression he intended to rectify. Publicly, he would continue to preach the necessity of grower organization; privately, he would spend much of the off-season trying to secure the services of the one he felt could ensure order in his orchards – Mousha Singh. </p>
<p>Pierce's anger stemmed from more than government neglect. This leading proponent of grower organization and grower-state cooperation remained obsessed with his own labor problems. At the time of his Commonwealth Club address, his efforts to bring Mousha Singh back to his Davis orchards had reached an impasse. Back in the fall of 1917, Pierce had located his former contractor in Hong Kong and quickly sent him a steamship ticket to recross the Pacific. But he received an unexpected telegram on February 26 from Angel Island Immigration Station on San Francisco Bay. Federal authorities had detained Mousha in compliance with the immigration bill Congress had passed in January that barred immigrants from India. Upon visiting Mousha on Angel Island, Pierce realized the gravity of the situation. On the advice of two CAGE attorneys, he made a formal appeal for Mousha's release, wrote several letters to Anthony Caminetti, the federal commissioner general of immigration, and visited Mousha on Angel Island several times. He finally agreed to serve as Mousha's legal guardian after the Sikh was released on a six-month bond pending a final decision on his case. After four months of detainment, Mousha left Angel Island on June 27 and was back at work on the Pierce ranch on June 29. And just as Pierce had expected, Mousha secured a labor force of 25 Sikhs to harvest almonds in August. Pierce made no effort to consult his neighbors or other CAGE embers on wage rates. The peace of mind he had finally secured was well worth the 40 cents an hour his workers demanded. </p>
The impact of Mexican immigration on labor relations was even more striking. It can be seen vividly in Pierce's experience. Before the 1919 harvest, Mousha Singh obtained permanent admission to the United States, on the grounds that he had acquired a residence in California prior to the passage of the 1917 immigration act. Once again, he gathered together a workforce of 28 Sikhs as the August harvest approached. This time, however, the harvesters upset the customary order of Pierce's orchards. After two weeks of knocking almonds, a “threatened strike materialized,” as Pierce recounted in his journal. His workers had discovered that higher wages awaited them in the orchards of two of Pierce's neighbors, who began offering a piece rate (50 cents a tree). After Mousha unsuccessfully attempted to find replacements, Pierce became frantic. More than half of his largest crop of almonds to date remained on the trees. Seeking help, he drove to two nearby ranches, but to no avail, Finally, he journeyed 25 miles to Vacaville, leaving word at two groceries that work could be found on his orchards. The next day, as Pierce explained in his journal, “One Spaniard came in auto to look at orchard and equipment. He decided to come with crew to knock almonds at 50 cents per hour.”
