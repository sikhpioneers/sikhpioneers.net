<p align="center" class="style1">A CROSSROAD OF INDIAN COMMUNITY </p>
<p class="style2">There is a clear image of each ethnic community in USA . It may be debatable, that is a separate question. Also, an image is not universal. The image of Indians in USA is not the same as in the UK , or in neighboring Canada . Images do undergo a change, but slowly. Nevertheless, a bottom line is: <strong>Image is every thing.</strong></p>
<p class="style2">The image of Indians in USA that was defined in 70's and 80's has begun to change. Primarily, it has been due to the migration of unskilled and retired dependents of the first generation of professionals from India. Also, the second generation is more entrepreneurial in every aspect in taking advantage of the variety of opportunities that this country offers. </p>
<p class="style2">Two recent news reports have shaken up the Indian community of Las Vegas . One 24 year old Indian woman arrested for prostitution in a casino. An undercover agent apprehended her for willing to perform an act for $500. The second was the arrest of an Indian youth under 21 involved in a DUI related auto accident that killed the other occupant. </p>
<p class="style2">My thoughts naturally went back to 30 years when there were hardly 20 Indian families in Las Vegas . Two were university professors; 3-4 engineers, 4 nurses, three architects, two casino workers, and the rest were Sindhis working out from Honk Kong in custom tailoring. There was no doctor, or a motel owner! </p>
<p class="style2">It was about 20 years ago when we heard of a young Hindu homeless pregnant girl. My wife and I being shocked, we drove to locate her walking dazed along a road side. She was mentally imbalanced. Besides, immediate help, we even arranged to pay for her airfare to India , and contacted her relatives there. </p>
<p class="style2"><strong>The point of the story is that we were no less concerned about Indians' image getting a bad rap </strong>. Incidentally, that is a story of survival too. Las Vegas some how reminds me of my home town Bathinda that was a junction of seven railway lines. The mentally sick thrown out of homes for social stigma boarded up the trains. Since every train eventually passing through Bathinda and stopping for an extended time, they would get down and live off the streets for the rest of their lives. Las Vegas , the fastest growing city in the US has also exploded with Indian population now touching 15,000. </p>
<p class="style2">With economic opportunities Indians of every shade of character, profession and trade are moving to Las Vegas . In the skin business, call girls and prostitutes thrive in legal brothels only 50 miles away, or in casinos under the protection of some casino employees. The Indian girl caught was perhaps too entrepreneur. Every weekend, youths are caught, killed in auto accidents while driving drunk. Indian kids can't stay unaffected. The parents are busier in jobs, earning more, less family time, and little to do with teens. </p>
<p class="style2">Fifteen years ago in Las Vegas , it was unheard of an Indian youth living away in an apartment while parents owning a 4-bed room house. It is very trendy today. On the top, there is no conforming holistic influence of religion, particularly of Hinduism. Hindu temples seem to be out of bound for the Hindu youth, and conversely. Christian and Mormon churches have youth programs on sex and drug education besides social gatherings. In contrast, the Hindu temples have yet to embrace such activities a part of religion. </p>
<p class="style2">The point of this <strong><em>Reflection </em></strong> is not just to bring a general awareness of the social problems of youth and adults, but also to bring the community together to address the issues. The places of worships are ideal to assume new roles and provide social environment. The federal government has generous funds to support such programs. The problems are never eliminated, but can be minimized. <strong>A new challenge always opens&nbsp;a door for new opportunity\ies. </strong></p>
