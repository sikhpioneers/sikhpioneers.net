<DIV align=left><IMG src="images/ball.gif"> <B>What is sikhism?</B> 
<BR>Sikhism is one of the youngest of world religions. It is barely over 500 
years old. Its founder, Guru Nanak, was born in 1469. Guru Nanak spread a simple 
message of "Ek Onkar": we are all one, created by One Creator of all Creation. 
This was at a time when India was being torn apart by castes, sectarianism, 
religious factions, and fanaticism. He aligned with no religion, and respected 
all religions. He expressed the reality that there is one God and many paths, 
and the name of God is Truth, "Sat Nam." <BR><BR>Guru Nanak's followers were 
sikhs(students of Truth). He taught them to bow only before God. He encouraged 
then to live thier lives in direct consciousness of God, experinecing no 
separation. Guru Nanak opposed superstition, injustice, and hypocrisy and 
inspired seekers by singing the divine songs which touched the hearts of the 
most callous listeners. These songs were recorded by hand, and formed the 
beginnings of th Sikhs' scared writings, later to become the Guru Granth 
Sahib.</DIV>

<DIV align=left><IMG src="images/ball.gif"> <B>The Khalsa</B> <BR>The 
Khalsa is a spiritual brotherhood and sisterhood devoted to purity of thought 
and action created by Guru Gobind Singh, who was the last Guru of the Sikhs. In 
order to preserve one's commitment to the Khalsa and help maintain an elevated 
state of consciousness, every baptized Sikh vows to wear the Five K's:</DIV>
<P></P>

<DIV align=left><B>Kesh</B>: uncut hair and beard, as given by God, to sustain 
him or her in higher consciousness. The Kesh is often kept in a turban, the 
crown of spirituality.</DIV>

<DIV align=left><B>Kanga</B>: a wooden comb to properly groom the hair as a 
symbol of cleanliness.</DIV>
