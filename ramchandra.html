<P align="left">RUDKIN, District Judge. This indictment was returned under section 
  37 of the Criminal Code (Act March 4, 1909, c. 321, 35 Stat. 1096 [Comp. St. 
  1916, §˜ 10201]), and charges a conspiracy to violate section 13 of the same 
  Code (section 10177). The former provides that: </P>
<H4 align="left"><EM>"If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense 
  against the United States in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more 
  of such parties do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each of the 
  parties to such conspiracy shall be fined not more than ten thousand dollars, 
  or imprisoned not more than two years, or both." </EM></H4>
<P align="left">pg. 636<BR>
  The latter provides that:</P>
<H4 align="left"> <EM>"Whoever, within the territory or jurisdiction of the United 
  States, begins, or sets on foot, or provides or prepares the means for, any 
  military expedition or enterprise, to be carried on from thence against the 
  against the territory or dominions of any foreign prince or state, or of any 
  colony, district, or people, with whom the United States are at peace, shall 
  be fined not more than three thousand dollars and imprisoned not more than three 
  years." </EM></H4>
<P align="left">[1,2] A number of the defendants have interposed demurrers to 
  this indictment, but the majority of them have been submitted without argument. 
  The demurrers argued have been pressed largely, if not solely, upon the ground 
  that the offense denounced by section 13 necessarily and logically requires 
  that the concurrence of a plurality of agents for its consummation, and that 
  such agents cannot be charged with conspiracy to commit offense. In other words, 
  it is claimed that the indictment in substance and effect charges conspiracy 
  to commit a conspiracy which is not permissible under the law. </P>
<P align="left">This argument is based largely on the rule laid down by Wharton: 
</P>
<H4 align="left"><EM>"When to the idea of an offense plurality of agents is logically 
  necessary, conspiracy, which assumes the voluntary accession of a person to 
  a crime of such a character that it is aggravated by a plurality of agents, 
  cannot be maintained. As crimes to which concert is necessary (i.e. which cannot 
  take place without concert), we may mention dueling, bigamy, incest, and adultery, 
  to the last of which the limitation here expressed has been specifically applied 
  by authoritative American courts. We have here the well-known distinction between 
  concursus necessaries and concursus facultativus, in the latter of which the 
  accession of a second agent to the offense is an element added to its conception, 
  and in the former of which the participation of two agents is essential to its 
  conception; and from this it follows that conspiracy, the gist of which is combination, 
  added to crime, does not lie for concursus necessarius. In other words, when 
  the law says: 'A combination between two persons to effect a particular end 
  shall be called, if the end be effected, by a certain name' -it is not lawful 
  for the prosecution to call it by some other name, and when the law says such 
  an offense-e.g., adultery- shall have a certain punishment, it is not lawful 
  for the prosecution to evade this limitation by indicting the offense as conspiracy." 
  Wharton's Criminal Law (10th Ed.) §˜ 1339. </EM></H4>
<P align="left">But, even in the cases suggested by the author, parties who are 
  not necessary participants in the crime may be indicted for a conspiracy to 
  commit crime. <BR>
  <BR>
  I fail to see any analogy between crimes of adultery, bigamy, incest, dueling, 
  or the giver and receiver of a bribe, and the crime denounced by section 13. 
  Doubtless a single individual would not constitute a military expedition, as 
  that term is usually defined, and whether a single individual in an aeroplane, 
  armed with bombs, would constitute a military enterprise, as suggested by one 
  court, I will not inquire.<BR>
  <BR>
  I see no reason, however, why a single individual may not begin or set on foot 
  a military expedition or enterprise, and more especially why a single individual 
  may not well provide or prepare the means for such an expedition or enterprise. 
  Everything must have a beginning, and this must necessarily be true, if the 
  words "to begin or set on foot" have the broad and comprehensive meaning attributed 
  to them by counsel for defense. They maintain that an act which would<BR>
  pg. 637<BR>
  tend to effect the object of a conspiracy would also constitute the beginning 
  or setting on foot of a military expedition or enterprise. I doubt the soundness 
  of this view, but I have no doubt that a single individual may violate section 
  13 of the Criminal Code. Thus in Wiborg v. United States, 163 U. S. 632, 648, 
  16 Sup. Ct. 1127, 1133 (41 L Ed. 289), the court said:</P>
<H4 align="left"> <EM>"We think that it does not admit of serious question that 
  providing or preparing the means of transportation for such a military expedition 
  or enterprise as is referred to in the statute is one of the forms of provision 
  or preparation therein denounced." </EM></H4>
<P align="left">Again the court said (163 U. S. 655, 16 Sup. Ct. 1136):</P>
<H4 align="left"> <EM>"It is true that the expedition started in the Southern 
  district of New York, and did not come into immediate contact with defendants 
  at any point within the jurisdiction of the United States, as the Horsa was 
  a foreign vessel; but the Horsa's preparation for sailing and the taking aboard 
  of the two boats at Philadelphia constituted a preparation of means for the 
  expedition or enterprise, and if defendants knew of the enterprise when they 
  participated in such preparation, then they committed the statutory crime upon 
  American soil, and in the Eastern district of Pennsylvania, where they were 
  indicted and tried." </EM> </H4>
<P align="left">It seems manifest that these acts might be committed without a 
  plurality of agents; indeed, while not controlling, it is a significant fact 
  that, for upwards of 100 years Congress has employed the singular number in 
  defining the crime here denounced. I am satisfied, therefore, that there is 
  no inconsistency or repugnancy in charging a conspiracy to violate section 13 
  of the Penal Code. I have read and examined the authorities cited by the defendants, 
  but have neither the time nor the disposition to review them at length. Suffice 
  it to say I find nothing in them inconsistent with the views here expressed. 
  <BR>
  <BR>
  [3] Of course, the fact that the object of conspiracy may have been consummated, 
  if such be the fact, is no defense.</P>
<H4 align="left"><EM>&quot;Again it is said that, if the evidence proved the petitioner 
  guilty of a conspiracy, it proved him guilty of the substantive offense. It 
  may be that there has been an abuse of indictment for conspiracy; as suggested 
  by Judge Holt in the Untied States v. Kissel [C. C.] 173 Fed. 823, 828; but 
  it hardly is made clear to us that this is an instance. At all events the liability 
  for conspiracy is not taken away by its success- that is, by the accomplishment 
  of that substantive offense at which the conspiracy aims." Heike v. United States, 
  227 U. S. 131, 144, 33 Sup. Ct. 226, 229 (57 L. Ed. 450, Ann. Cas. 1914C 128).
