    Waraich has been reconstructing the history of Ghadar movement page by glorious 
    page. &quot;I am not a historian, I am a mere collector,&quot; says Waraich, 
    sitting in his room full of books, court judgments, government records, manuscripts 
    and Ghadar memorabilia he has been collecting with rare perspicacity and rather 
    inspiration. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a fondness 
    shot through with nostalgia, Waraich points at a sepia photograph hanging 
    on the wall. These Ghadarites were clicked just after they were released from 
    jail in early 30's. Sohan Singh Bhakna, Sant Vasakha Singh, Harnam Singh Tundi 
    Lat; slowly, the names drop from his lips, heavy with memories, each launching 
    a train of thoughts which trundles through his mind, rousing various emotions. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Baba Bhakna 
    used to lift his finger while talking. Sometimes he just fell silent and would 
    not answer our questions for hours,&quot; remember Waraich. He is talking 
    of Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna who kick-started the Ghadar movement in California. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have done 
    nothing. No jails, no suffering, no privations. I feel privileged to be associated 
    with the Ghadarites for nothing,&quot; says Waraich who has been a professor 
    of Humanities at Guru Nank Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana and now has a 
    practice in Criminal Law at the High Court. Waraich's student Jagmohan, Bhagat 
    Singh's nephew, once listened to Bhakana at a public function and told Waraich 
    how Bhakna had talked of handing over the Ghadar legacy to the younger generation. 
    That bit took Waraich to Bhakna and he formed a close association with him. 
    Impressed by the ideology which was, in the words of O'Dwyer, &quot;by far 
    the most serious attempt to subvert the British rule in India,&quot; Waraich 
    started looking for other heroes of Ghadar who were flung by time to the margins 
    of contemporary world in which both they and Ghadar were flagrant anachronisms. 
    Baba Hari Singh Usman, who set out with a ship full of weapons from the US, 
    stayed in Java where he escaped death sentence and served in the INA, was 
    a sweeper in a school at a village near Ludhiana when discovered by Waraich. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waraich has also 
    edited autobiographies of Baba Usman and Sohan Singh Bhakna and poetry and 
    diaries of Lala Ram Saran Das Talwar and Giani Harbhajan Singh Chaminda. He 
    is editing the files of Lahore Conspiracy Case, autobiography of Baba Vasakha 
    Singh and the trial of Madan Lal Dhingra. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I used to 
    make notes while talking to the Ghadarites. So you can call me their munshi,&quot; 
    Waraich says. He went as far as a remote village of UP for Baba Vasakha Singh's 
    autobiography. He has scoured lineages, climbed up many a family trees to 
    collect information on dead and long-forgotten Ghadarites. Waraich has filed 
    a PIL against the sorry amnesia of the government which has Ghadar in its 
    lists misspelled as Chaddar. Between history and hagiography, Waraich toils 
    to reclaim the subalterns from least deserved oblivion. <br>
