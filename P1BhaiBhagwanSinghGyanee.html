<p align="center"><strong>Bhai Bhagwan Singh Gyanee </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>(The Story of my Grandfather) </em></strong></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>He was a fiery orator, a revolutionary poet and president of the Gadar party from 1914 to 1920. He was also a founder of the “Humanology Society” and“The American Institute of Culture” (1930) with affiliated “Self Culture Associations.” He was a philosopher, educationist, creative thinker and author of several books including, The Art of Living, Science of Perpetual Youth, The Ideal of Friendship, Humanology Notes, Paths to Perfection, Why Men Fail, Gyana Yoga, Concentration, Mysteries and Functions of the Subconscious Mind, Love Marriage and Divorce, The Greatest Enemy of Man, Creative Wisdom, Principles and the Law, Karma and Dharma, as well as many others. </em></strong></p>
<p>Bhai Bhagwan Singh was born in the small village of Wring, near Sarhali, Dist. Amritsar, Punjab on July 27, 1884. His father was Sri Sarmukh Singh and mother Srimati Har Kaur. He was the only surviving adult of nine children. He learned Urdu in village primary school but due to harsh treatment from his teacher for being late one day, even when he was telling the truth, he left school. His main or formal education was under the guidance of his paternal grandfather, Baba Rattan Singh who taught him Sikh history, Punjabi literature, Adi and Dasam Granth and also familiarized him with Sikh Religio-Political traditions. Baba Ji was a Hakim, had served in the Khalsa Army and had fought against the British during the Anglo-Sikh wars. Bhai Bhagwan Singh also stayed involved in wrestling and athletics and was a physically strong person. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>At the age of twenty, Bhai Bhagwan Singh was admitted to Updeshak College at Gujranwala where he completed Budhivan, Vidvan and Giani, all in eleven months. He was appointed as a teacher in the same college. In the following year, 1907, he was appointed lecturer on Sikhism, in which capacity he traveled extensively covering Northern India from Delhi to Peshawar. It was during this time that he became a Nationalist. He delivered anti-government speeches during the Agrarian unrest of 1907-1908. He met many leaders and gave many lectures alongside Sadar Ajit Singh, uncle of Shaheed Bhagat Singh. In the middle of 1908, after the suppression of the uprising in Punjab, the revolutionary movement went underground. Bhai Bhagwan Singh became a teacher in Daska, Dist. Sialkot, during which time he met Saint Har Bilas under whom he studied the Six Systems of Hindu Philosophy, the Upanishads, the Bhagvad Gita, Vedanta and Nyaya-Systems of Logic, etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>During this time Bhai Bhagwan Singh also remained politically active and it became necessary for him to leave India in August of 1909. From Calcutta, under an assumed name, he traveled covering Burma, Siam, Malay Straits, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and Singapore, everywhere preaching nationalism, mostly to Army soldiers. While in Ipoh he was ordered to leave by a Subedar from his own village. He gave revolutionary speeches while he was a Granthi at Penang Gurdwara. </p>
<p>Bhai Bhagwan Singh next reached Hong Kong in March 1910. His intention was to proceed to U.S.A., but after listening to his lectures, the central Sikh temple commitee made an offer and he accepted the position of the Granthi. Here he had a fierce clash with Police Jamadar Lal Singh who also happened to be president of the Gurdwara. Lal Singh was a very powerful police figure whom many people feared. By this time Bhai Bhagwan Singh had gained much popularity and support. He was able to gather 500 signatures which he submitted to the Governor of Hong Kong regarding Lal Singh's unnecessary interference in the Gurdwara's affairs. As a result, Lal Singh was ordered to either apologize or be prohibited from entering the Gurdwara. The position as a Granthi gave him easy access to all strata of society, including the army, where he could come and go at will. He secretly preached revolution. The Sunday meetings at the Gurdwara were being attended not only by Sikhs but by Muslims and Hindus as well. Except for a few Subedars the entire army and officers were ready to take up the cause of India's independence. Bhagwan Singh relayed this information to Dr. Sun Yat Sen, the famous Chinese revolutionary, who did not think China was strong enough then to incur the hostility of the British. While in Hong Kong, he was twice arrested, once in 1911 and again in 1912, both times for preaching Sedition. Dr. Kir Pal Singh in an article published in “The Sikh Review” wrote <strong><em>“This trumpet call to duty was responded to by the Sikhs living all over the world. Bhai Bhagwan Singh, the priest of Sikh temple in Hong Kong, took up that cause of his country's freedom. Poet as he was, he recited poems in Punjabi, breathing revolution, enjoining upon the audience to struggle hard against tyranny and oppression. The revolutionary priest greatly inspired Baba Gurdit Singh of Kamagata Maru... The British government in Hong Kong was so upset by the outpourings of Bhai Bhagwan Singh that the Sikh military men living there were prohibited to attend the Gurdwara.” </em></strong><em></em></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In May 1913, Bhai Bhagwan Singh, after making arrangements for his wife and three children to return to India, arrived in British Columbia, Canada. There he openly clashed with an English man by the name of Hopkinson who had been sent by the British Government of India in order to keep the community of four thousand Indians living in Canada disunited. Bhagwan Singh reorganized the United India League and Guru Nanak Mining Company which had almost ceased to function. He also unified not only the Sikhs among themselves, but the Indian community as a whole. Two months after his arrival, he was arrested but released on two thousand dollars bail. A special order was secured from the Governor General of Canada for his deportation. Thus five months after his arrival in Canada, he was dragged out in the middle of the night, on November 18, 1913, from the home of Babu Harnam Singh Sahri (later martyred) and deported, even though two writs of habeas corpus had been issued. He was man handled, physically injured, and literally thrown on the “Empress of Japan”, destination India. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The following is extracted from “Gadar Movement” by Harish Puri. <strong><em>“The arrival of Gyanee Bhagwan Singh in Vancouver in the early months of 1913 gave a real spurt to a revolutionary political movement in Canada. Bhagwan Singh had been a Sikh priest in the Gurdwaras at Perak in the Federated Malay States and at Hong Kong, and was orator of great merit. He was the first man to deliver vigorous revolutionary diatribes against the British rule... The special tribunal in Lahore conspiracy judgement rightly observed —Vancouver became the first centre of seditious propaganda among Indians until it was eclipsed by that of California with the launching of Gadar movement.” </em></strong>Also (taken from “War Against King Emperor”, page xiv); <strong><em> “The prosecution has not considered it necessary to place before us much evidence in regard to Vancouver, but we know from confession of Nand Singh (p. 407) that one Bhagwan Singh, a noted seditionist, arrived there at the end of 1912 or beginning of 1913, and commenced a series of lectures against the British government in India, He also started lecturing in the Vancouver Hall, remaining there for three months, filling, as Nand Singh says, his audience with revolutionary ideas. Bhagwan Singh was eventually deported, but not before the seeds of mischief had been sown among the Indians at Vancouver.” </em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In spite of his injuries, Bhagwan Singh managed to escape his guard once in Japan. He knew that continuing the journey to India would have been fatal. In Japan he stayed with Maulvi Barak Tullah who was a professor of languages at the Imperial University at Tokyo. Here they met with Dr. Sun Yat Sen as well as Prince Toyama, the head of the very powerful Dragon Society <em></em>of Japan. The need to secure arms and ammunition caused Bhagwan Singh to leave Japan in March 1914 for Germany on a Japanese Ship, but he was discovered by the British at Shanghai. Upon reaching Hong Kong a warrant was issued for his arrest and the ship was searched. However through the assistance of the captain he disguised himself as a Japanese, escaped again to Japan and rejoined professor Barak Tullah. While the Komagatu Maru was docked in Yokohama, Bhagwan Singh and Barak Tullah gave two lectures to the passengers and informed them of the conditions prevailing in Canada which was the destination of the ship. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>On May 23, 1914 Bhagwan Singh along with Barak Tullah landed in San Francisco. They immediately went to the Gadar Ashram, 430 Hill Street. Shortly after their arrival, Bhagwan Singh was elected president, professor Barak Tullah Vice President, and Pandit Ram Chandra given the responsibility of “ Hindustan Gadar.”, the weekly official publication. Moreover the three of them were appointed Commissioners. A few months later the first World War was declared. In their Commission meeting held in August 1914, it was decided to declare Open Warfare against British rule in India and proclaim India a FREE and SOVEREIGN REPUBLIC. Gyanee Ji wrote “Ailan-e-Jung”. (The Declaration of War). As a result of this meeting Barak Tullah was sent to Persia, Afghanistan, Turkey, etc and Bhagwan Singh was assigned to cover Japan, North and South China, Korea, Manchuria, and The Phillippines. In Japan Bhagwan Singh and Rash Behari Bose met in a very dramatic way. As a result Bhagwan Singh authorized and sent Rash Behari Bose to Germany on a secret mission. It was in Nanking, on a Chinese Ship, Bhagwan Singh wrote a booklet entitled “Jung or Azadi” ( War and Freedom), which embodied the aims discussed at the August meeting in San Francisco. With the help of Germans, Two Hundred Thousand copies were distributed among Indians all over Malaya, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and The Phillippines These were also sent to the thirty-five thousand Indian war prisoners held in Germany, most of whom were Sikhs. Bhagwan Singh was arrested in the Phillippines. Warrants were also issued in China for the arrest of Bhagwan Singh, Rash Behari Bose and Gopal Singh. In Manilla Bhai Bhagwan Singh had a secret meeting with Hafiz Abdullah who was later martyred. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In June of 1916 while still in China, Bhagwan Singh made secret arrangements to return to San Francisco hidden in a cargo ship loaded with cowhides As he did so without passport or ticket, to avoid legal problems, he was forced to escape to Panama. Here too he was ordered to leave. He bought a ticket and while on his way to Galveston, Texas, aboard a U.S. fruit ship, he was removed in Havana, held for three days by immigration and sent back to Panama. Finally, Bhagwan Singh on the advice and help of General George Goethal, the builder and governor of the Panama Canal, he reentered the United States, legally, landing in New York on October 11, 1916, only to face arrest a few months later in the famous San Francisco Hindu conspiracy case. As his bail had been set at twenty-five thousand dollars, the highest amount among the so-called conspirators, he remained in custody for six months during the trial period. On judgement day, Bhagwan Singh was given the maximum sentence of two years , minus six months already spent in county jail. He served the prison time at McNeill Island Federal Penitentiary. Besides doing hard labor, Bhagwan Singh availed the opportunity and read many English books on various subjects. Just before he was to be released, he was again arrested for deportation but was released on ten thousand dollars bail. He fought his own case and finally in 1920, the deportation proceedings were dropped. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In 1948, at the request of his countrymen, Bhagwan Singh returned to the Pacific coast, holding meetings and editing and publishing a monthly periodical “Nav-Yug” for eighteen months. As soon as India was free, he applied for his passport to return home which he did not receive for two years. It was during this time his wife, Harbans Kaur, died without ever seeing her husband again. At long last, upon the invitation of Partap Singh Kairon, Chief Minister of Punjab (under pressure from family and friends) Bhagwan Singh returned to India. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><em>“After nearly fifty years in exile in foreign lands, I'm home. I left incognito-under an assumed name to work for freedom, I returned a free man on an Indian ship under own flag.” said Gyanne Ji. His first act on landing at Bombay harbor was to bend on his knees and say “Bande-Matram” and then he laid flat on his belly to kiss the motherland which was “Free at last.” </em></strong>This was a scene to watch. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><em>Kuli Kuli Pukarda Jag Saanun </em></strong>We are called coolies in countries abroad </p>
<p><strong><em>Saada Jhulda Kitey Nishan Kiyon Nahin </em></strong>We do not have a flag of our own </p>
<p><strong><em>Kikoon Bachangey Sada Ghulam Rahkey </em></strong>Will we always live the life of slaves? </p>
<p><strong><em>Saanun Rajniti Wala Giyan Kiyon Nahin </em></strong>Why do we not know the science of politics? </p>
<p><strong><em>Dhayi Totru Kha Gaye Khet Sada </em></strong> A handful of people have taken control of our land </p>
<p><strong><em>Hindustan da Koi Kisan Kiyon Nahin </em></strong>Why is there not a caretaker of Hindustan? </p>
