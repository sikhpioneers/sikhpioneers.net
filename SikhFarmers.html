  <H2><B>Pioneer Asian Indian Migration to North America</B> </H2>
  <P align="center">The Punjab province, which is part of present-day India and 
    Pakistan, was a great source of Asian Indian immigration to the United States 
    and Canada. The first immigrants arrived in Vancouver, British Columbia, to 
    celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. At the time, the predominant method 
    of traveling overseas was by boat. The early settlers were predominantly Sikh 
    with fewer numbers being Hindu, Muslim, and other faiths. Furthermore, immigrants 
    made their way into the United States from Canada as discrimination, resistance, 
    and intolerance grew. It is estimated that 7,348 Asian Indians migrated to 
    the United States and Canada between 1899 and 1920. </P>
  <P align="center">Many immigrants had farming backgrounds or were part of the 
    British Indian Army, and they arrived in the U.S. looking for railroad, lumber, 
    or agricultural jobs. In Northern California, two thousand Punjabis primarily 
    worked on Western Pacific Railways to construct a 700-mile road between Oakland 
    and Salt Lake City, which is probably modern interstate 80. Some of the Punjabis 
    took jobs in Lumber Mills and logging camps in Oregon, Washington and California. 
    Those that became migrant laborers in the Sacramento Valley were known as 
    "Hindu crews." They encountered resistance, both in Canada and the United 
    States. In addition to being viewed as eccentric dressers they were also confronted 
    by legal oppositions. </P>

        <H2>Early Immigrants Arriving at Angel Island </H2>
        <P>As immigration restrictions tightened in Canada, more immigrants came 
          directly to California, passing through the Angel Island station on 
          their way to San Francisco. Angel Island is the lesser-known sibling 
          of the more famous Ellis Island of the Atlantic seaboard. Where Ellis 
          Island processed immigrants crossing the Atlantic, the Angel Island 
          Immigration Station, located in the middle of the San Francisco Bay, 
          was often the first stop for any immigrant crossing the Pacific. Between 
          1910 and 1940, hundreds of thousands of immigrants, from places such 
          as China, India, Japan, and Korea were stationed, quarantined, questioned, 
          and processed at this historical site. </P>

  <H2 align="center">Early Immigrants in Rail and Lumber Industries </H2>
  <P align="center">The first wave of immigrants came to North America to do laboring 
    jobs on railway construction, in the lumber mills, and in forestry. Even though 
    they were unskilled and uneducated, they were favored by employers because 
    they were hardworking and reliable, and because the employers could pay the 
    Sikhs less than White men for the same work. </P>
  <P align="center">Between 1903-1908, Punjabis primarily worked on Western Pacific 
    Railways in Northern California. Two thousand Punjabis worked on a 700-mile 
    road between Oakland and Salt Lake City, which is probably modern interstate 
    80. </P>
  <P align="center">The largest mill community was located at Fraser Mills in 
    New Westminster, close to Maillardville; it was called "Millside." According 
    to Mawa Mangat, who came to Canada in 1925, " There were only two families 
    there then, the rest were all single men." The company even built a temple 
    for its workers in about 1908. Sardara Gill, who came to join his father to 
    live and work here in 1925, says that when he arrived, there were between 
    200 to 300 Sikhs. They had four or five cookhouses and different sized bunkhouses, 
    some had thirty, forty or fifty people living in them. It was a very good 
    company, but there was a five-cent difference between Sikh's and white people. 
    The same was true for the railroad manufacturing jobs. </P>
  <P align="center">Other avenues of employment started to open up in the mid-1930s. 
    This greatly expanded their financial opportunitiesand gave them more economic 
    freedom and autonomy. </P>

  <H2 align="center">Overcoming Resistance and Discrimination </H2>
  <P align="center">Once they settled in the Sacramento Valley, the early immigrants 
    were pleased with the amount of agricultural work available and with the mild 
    climate. Unfortunately, it was not long before native Californians expressed 
    their agitated feelings towards the further immigration of these "Hindus". 
    The California Board of Control submitted a report to Governor Stephens in 
    1920 titled California and the Orientals: Japanese, Chinese and Hindus. It 
    indicated that since 1910, the number of Asian Indians in the United States 
    had increased by 33.5%. The California Board of Control perceived these immigrants 
    as an economic threat, or competition for native farmers. They were referred 
    to as "a group of laborers becoming landowners and threatening the monopoly 
    of the majority group." </P>
  <P align="center">The California Alien Land Law of 1913, revised in 1920, prevented 
    immigrants from owning and leasing their own land, making it a difficult struggle 
    for those who made their living as farmers. A second indication of the discrimination 
    which existed toward Asian Indians appeared in the Stephens report. </P>
  <P align="center">Canada also curtailed immigration in 1909. The immigration 
    Act of 1917 dictated that Indian Laborers were no longer able to enter the 
    United States; this native country existed in the "barred zone" identified 
    in the Act. </P>

  <H2 align="center">The Origin of the "Mexican-Hindus" </H2>
  <P align="center">A small "Mexican-Hindu" community formed in California when 
    early male Punjabi immigrants married Hispanic women. Many of the men were 
    unable to retrieve their family members from India, and thus were forced to 
    seek new relationships in the United States. Barred from owning land due to 
    anti-Asian laws, many married Mexican women and forged a fusion culture that 
    flourished in California's Yuba City and Imperial Valley. </P>
  <P align="center">Producing children with names like "Maria Singh" or "Jose 
    Rai," these "Mexidu" families have largely been forgotten as a new generation 
    of immigrants has laid down roots. Both cultures shared a rural life and a 
    lower-class status. Sets of Hispanic sisters or female relatives married Punjabi 
    business partners, forming joint households. Male friendship and female kinship 
    became the structure for family life. </P>
  <P align="center">The two cultures experienced different rights under the law. 
    Punjabi men were unable to legally own land. The Mexican women, however, could 
    own land, as they were unrestricted by discriminatory laws targeted at Asian 
    immigrants. But if a Mexican woman married a Punjabi man, she would then become 
    ineligible for land rights due to the specifications of the Cable Act. To 
    get around this dilemma, the men turned to Anglo landowners, lawyers and judges 
    to hold land for them, and to honor verbal leases. Later, they also put land 
    in their children's names, who were American citizens. </P>

  <H2 align="center">Religion and The Role of the Gurdwara in Immigration </H2>
  <P align="center">Between 1901-1915, the place of Gurdwara (Sikh Temple) became 
    the center of the immigrants' movement primarily because 95 percent of the 
    immigrant were Sikhs. After a few years of service in Malaysia and China, 
    they managed to save some money and were able to repay the loans owned to 
    the moneylenders. With their main problem alleviated, they started to think 
    about praticing the Sikh tradition again. They got involved in constructing 
    places of worship such as the Gurdwaras. They would meet in the Gurdwaras 
    during the weekends to think about their common welfare. The Gurdwaras became 
    places to welcome new arrivals and to help these new immigrants to look for 
    jobs or until they can look after themselves. </P>
  <P align="center">The Sikhs built huge and elegant Gurdwaras in many locations 
    including Penang, Singapore, Hong Kong (1901), and Shanghai. However, the 
    influence did not stop here. It also spread to Canada and the United States; 
    the Gurdwaras built in Vancouver, Canada (1908) and Stockton, California (1915) 
    were such examples. </P>
  <P align="center">These Gurdwaras provided shelter, food, and social life to 
    all immigrants without any consideration of caste, creed, or religion. Hindus 
    and Muslims were also attending and living in these Gurdwaras. </P>
  <P align="center">Congressman Dalip Singh Saund was the first Asian American 
    to be elected to the US Congress and to date remains the only Indian American. 
    He was elected in 1956 from 29th Congressional district comprised of Riverside 
    and Imperial Counties of California and reelected twice. While contesting 
    in 1964 for his fourth term in the U.S. Congress, he suffered a stroke and 
    became incapacitated. He did not win his fourth term. However, he did set 
    a precedent for many Asians to follow in the U.S. Congress. He remains a beacon 
    of hope and an example for many Indian Americans to succeed him. </P>
  <P align="center">Saund was born on September 20, 1899 in village Chhajalwadi, 
    Amritsar, Punjab. He went to a boarding school in Amritsar and Prince of Wales 
    College in Jammu. He graduated with B.A. degree in Mathematics from Punjab 
    University in 1919. In the US, he enrolled in UC Berkeley in 1920 to study 
    food preservation, in the department of Agriculture. Later, he switched to 
    Mathematics and received MA in 1922 and Ph.D. in 1924. </P>
  <P align="center">As a student in India, Saund was impressed with Gandhi. He 
    became his ardent and active follower. At the same time, he became profound 
    admirer of the then American president, Woodrow Wilson whose speeches he read 
    over and over again. His inspiring ideas and ideals to "make the world safe 
    for democracy" and provide "self-determination for all peple" appealed to 
    him enormously. It was through Wilson that he became familiar with President 
    Abraham Lincoln. He read Lincoln's life story and studied his writings that 
    made an everlasting impression on his young mind. In the preface to his autobiography, 
    Congressman From Indian, he wrote, "My guideposts were two of the most beloved 
    men in history, Abraham Lincoln and Mahatma Gandhi". Since Lincoln had influenced 
    him so much, he came to the U.S. for further studies in spite of opposition 
    from his family. </P>
  <P align="center">Dalip S. Saund was elected Judge solely due to his exemplary 
    grasssroots campaigning</P>

  <H2 align="center">Pioneer Asian Indians Contribute to Farming </H2>
  <P align="center">Once the early immigrants left the lumber and railroad industry, 
    they returned to farming jobs, well known by these pioneers. By 1910, the 
    agricultural business expanded swiftly, and Punjabis started getting higher 
    wages because of their traditional agricultural expertise. Punjabis originated 
    from Indus valley. History experts consider Indus valley civilization as a 
    first civilization to invent agriculture. </P>
  <P align="center">Punjabi settlements began in farming lands in the Sacramento 
    valley, San Joaquin Valley and in the Imperial Valley in California. Most 
    Sikhs worked for the next few years and established permanent homes. Some 
    worked in the Vacaville Orchards. Five Hundred were living in Newcastle, picking 
    and hoeing orchards. In 1909, four hundred worked in the best fields in Hamilton, 
    Oxnard and Visalia. Most eventually settled in these places. In Fresno, ranchers 
    considered the Punjabis reliable in financial dealings. By 1919, about 60% 
    of the Imperial Valley was owned by non-residents. Nearly tenant farmers ran 
    88% of all ranches by 1924. They were able to provide regular profit from 
    land without supervision. Punjabis were not content to remain laborers, and 
    they started pooling money to lease land. Then they started seeking loans. 
    By this time they had acquired some capital and their reputation as hard workers 
    was already established. They were viewed as reliable borrowers. Many Punjabis 
    decided to stay in the Imperial Valley. The current mayor of El Centro is 
    a third generation Punjabi-Mexican, David Singh Dhillon. </P>

  <H3>In Yuba-Sutter County, Sikh farmers account for:</H3>
  <H3>95% of the peach farming<BR>
    60% prune farming<BR>
    20% almonds and Walnuts</H3>
  <H3>In the Bakersfield &amp; Freson area 20% of the table grapes are grown by 
    Sikh farmers.</H3>

  <H2>Sikh's U.S. Success is Felt Near and Far</H2>
  <P>Forty years ago, Didar Singh Bains came to American with $8 in his pocket 
    with the belief that money grows on trees. He was right.</P>
  <P>Bains was a young &quot;jat&quot; - A Sikh farmer from the Indian state of 
    Punjab, where farming is next to godliness. He took one whiff of the prime 
    Columbian loam lining the fields of Sutter County and figured he'd found paradise.</P>
  <P>Driving tractors and irrigating orchards for 75 cents an hour, he did the 
    work of four men, and soon bought his first peach orchard. He bought another, 
    then another, and by 1978, had become the largest peach grower in California.</P>
  <P>Today Bains - whose first name roughly means &quot;visionary&quot; in Punjabi 
    - owns more than 40 parcels of land in 13 counties, including 667 acres nect 
    ot Sacramento International Airport and much of rapidly developing western 
    Yuba City.</P>
  <P>The turban-clad Bains, who hasn't cut his silver beard since 1982, is now 
    one of the wealthiest men in Northern California, worth somewhere in the neighborhood 
    of $50 million.</P>
  <P>&quot;I worked from 5 a.m. until 10 p.m.&quot; said Baines</P>
  <P>Bains, like most other Sikh immigrants, learned the secrets of farming in 
    the fertile fields of Punjab, whice means &quot;five rivers.&quot;</P>
  <P>He followed his father and grandfather into the orchards of Sutter County, 
    and after three years without a day off, had saved enough to buy a 25-acre 
    farm.</P>
  <P>by 1980, Bains owned 12,000 acres in California and Canada.</P>
