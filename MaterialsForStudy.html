<p class="style2"><em>It has been said of Sikhs that they are too busy making their history to record it. With the exception of a small number of dedicated scholars (such as Prof. Ganda Singh, Khushwant Singh, etc.) this is unfortunately true, particularly in North America. This situation need not continue for there is a significant amount of published material available for the researcher of Sikh history in the United States and Canada. The difficulty is that such materials are scattered over a seventy-year period, often to be found in obscure journals or special collections. IN order to promote and facilitate research by Sikhs on Sikh history, the Sikh Sansar with reprint a series in successive issues that is perhaps the most extensive bibliography now available on South Asian immigration to North America. Originally compiled and annotated by an anthropologist working among California Sikh communities, the bibliography has been expanded for SIKH SANSAR and a section added on archival resources. We hope that making such resources available will create an interest in the history of Sikh immigration and settlement in North America and stimulate further research. The author and editor realize that this initial bibliographical effort is only a beginning. We encourage our readers to bring to our attention additional citations of articles, books, and pamphlets which may have been overlooked. We further urge anyone who knows of the existence or location of other types of historic materials (such as family histories, legal documents, correspondence, diaries, photographs, tape recordings, etc.) which could be made available for study and cataloging to contact Sikh Sansar. IN this way we can add to our knowledge and understanding of Sikh history in North America and preserve the story of our struggles and successes for future generations. </em></p>
<p class="style2"><strong>&ldquo;British Indians and Citizenship in White Men&rsquo;s Countries,&rdquo; THE OUTLOOK. 87:1 (September 7, 1907), pp. 7-8. <br />
</strong>In this brief summary, the author discusses the possible impact of U.S. Attorney General Bonaparte&rsquo;s ruling that natives of British India were ineligible as U.S. citizens on the governments of Natal and Transvaal in South Africa. The U.S. ruling was asked for and handed down &ldquo;as a consequence of Hindus &hellip; having applied for citizenship&rdquo; in San Francisco. The author contends that the U.S. ruling will not be objected to by the British government, but a similar denial from the Boer government might strain British relations with its colony. The South African arguments against equal treatment of East Indians were both racial and economic. East Indians are currently denied citizenship in now-independent South Africa.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>&ldquo;The Hindu: The filth of Asia,&rdquo; THE WHITE MAN. (August 1910).<br />
</strong>The Self-explanatory title reveals the nature of the article. Typical of the hate literature genre, its main appeal was to emotion and prejudice. This particularly scurrilous magazine was dedicated to &ldquo;Racial Segregation and International Equity&rdquo; and was published in San Francisco during one period of anti-Asian activity. </p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Johnson, Annette Thachwell. &ldquo;Armageddon?&rdquo; INDEPENDENT. 109 (November 25, 1922), pp. 296-298. </strong><br />
In this literary style account of the origins of Sikhism with brief references to the grievances against the British and Canadians, Johnson dramatically tries to point up the crisis over acceptance or rejection of Sikhs in Canada and the United States. She concludes that, &ldquo;If we do not do something for the Orientals in our midst &ndash; they will do something to us,&rdquo; and that Americans should, &ldquo; &hellip;. Change a m&eacute;nage into an asset.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>&ldquo;Hindus Too Brunette to Vote Here,&rdquo; LITERARY DIGEST. 76.13 (March 10, 1923), p.13.<br />
</strong>Reflection continued opposition to Hindu immigration, this article cites California newspaper comments on the Thind case. Papers which approved the action included the <em>Sacramento Bee</em> and the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>. The Overall tenor is reflected in the Chronicle quote, &ldquo;We have already in this country all the race problems we can handle.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>&ldquo;United States vs. Bhagat Singh Thind, Decided February 19, 1923,&rdquo; SUPREME COURT REPORTER. 43:10 (April 1, 1923), pp. 338-342.<br />
</strong>This is the legal summary of the case in which &ldquo;Hindus&rdquo; (the defendant was a Sikh) were declared ineligible for citizenship.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Das, Taraknath. &ldquo;Stateless Persons in the U.S.A.,&rdquo; CALCUTTA REVIEW. 16:1 (July 1925), pp. 40-46. (Third Series).<br />
</strong>The author provides and excellent short review of the specific acts which reduced many East Indians and their American wives to the status of &ldquo;stateless persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Chase, Raymond and S.G. Pandit. AN EXAMINATION OF THE OPINION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES DECIDING AGAINST THE ELIGIBILITY OF HINDUS FOR CITIZENSHIP. Los Angeles: privately printed (penker, Stone and Baird Co.), 1926. 18 pp.<br />
</strong>This pamphlet discusses two key concepts of the Thind Case (1923): first, the notion of &ldquo;free white person&rdquo; and; second, the use of assimilability as a criterion of statutory race (p. 12), as well as the assumed &ldquo;will of Congress&rdquo; for racial homogeneity among American citizens. The authors conclude that the Thind Decision should be revised.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Schibsby, Marian, &ldquo;Hindus and American Citizenship.&rdquo; In &lsquo;PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF SOCIAL WORK, 1927, pp. 579-581. <br />
</strong>In this short statement, Schibsby sympathetically notes the difficulties caused East Indians by the Sutherland decision of 1923, and concludes that, &ldquo;At the present time &hellip; the Hindus have reason to feel more hopeful.&rdquo; The optimism was premature as rectifying legislation was not enacted until 1946. </p>
<p class="style2"><strong>&ldquo;Race Discrimination in Naturalization,&rdquo; IOWA LAW BULLETIN. 8 (1928), pp. 129-161.<br />
</strong>The legality and propriety of denying naturalization on the basis of &ldquo;racial&rdquo; classification (citing the Thind case) are questioned.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>McGovney, D.O. &ldquo;Naturalization of the Mixed Blood-A Dictum,&rdquo; CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW. 2 (May 1934), pp. 377-391.<br />

<p class="style2"><strong>Pandia, D.P. and MMe. Kamaladevi. &ldquo;Justive for Hindus in America,&rdquo; THE CHRISTIAN CENTURY. 57 (March 13, 1940), p. 357.<br />
</strong>This is one of many &ldquo;letters-to-the-editor&rdquo; written by East Indians abroad in support of the efforts of U.S. East Indians to abolish &ldquo;alien land laws&rdquo; and &ldquo;barred zone&rdquo; provisions, and, in some cases restore citizenship and the right to naturalization. The authors contend that approximately fifty Hindus were being threatened with deportation at the time &ndash; their only crime being entering the country illegally (some as long as 20 years before). </p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Samras, K.R. &ldquo;Naturalization for Hindus,&rdquo; NATION. 151 (November 23, 1940), p. 516.<br />
</strong>Another &ldquo;letter-to-the-editor&rdquo; written by a Berkeley-based Indian to generate support of his petition for citizenship. Realizing that the courts would deny his petition based on the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 1923 ruling (the Thind decision), he intended to make a test case of his naturalization attempt and to aid the &ldquo;4,000 Hindus, one-fourth of whom are married to American citizens.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Jacoby, Harold S. &ldquo;More Thind Against Than Sinning,&rdquo; PACIFIC HISTORIAN. 2:4 (November 1958), p.1.<br />
</strong>Jacoby reviews the case in which Bhagat Singh Thind was declared ineligible for citizenship on the basis of race. Although &ldquo;scientifically&rdquo; classified as Caucasian, East Indians were considered &ldquo;Oriental&rdquo; by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which agitated to have Indians declared ineligible for citizenship. Justice Sutherland, rendering the decision for the Supreme Court, declared that not all &ldquo;Caucasians&rdquo; are &ldquo;white persons.&rdquo; The legal consequences of this judgment are noted, including the cancellation of citizenship of over forty naturalized East Indians.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Gardner, Ray. &ldquo;when Vancouver Turned Back The Sikhs,&rdquo; MACLEANS MAGAZINE. November 8, 1958, pp. 31.<br />
</strong>A popular but well-researched account of the Komagata Maru incident which examines conflicts among the Sikhs as well as the political and moral issues involving Canada, Great Britain and India.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Chandra, Kananur V. SOCIAL DISCRIMINATION IN CANADA: ASIAN MINORITIES. San Francisco: R and E Research Associates, 1973. 80 pp.<br />
</strong>Based on a study attempting to define the nature and extent for discrimination against minority groups from India, Pakistan, and Bangla Desh who were residents of Montreal in 1971, personal interviews with 180 East Indians (of a total East Indian population of about 1800) and 76 interviews with &ldquo;potential discriminators&rdquo; were conducted. A final field test was devised in which 140 situations where discrimination could be measure were &ldquo;set-up.&rdquo; The results showed a definite pattern of differential treatment against &ldquo;colored migrants,&rdquo; particularly in housing and economic spheres. The main reason given by Canadian employers for refusing to hire East Indians was that they had &ldquo;no Canadian experience&rdquo; (i.e., lack of familiarity with Canadian cultural and social institutions), and not because of a lack of job skills. </p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Jensen, Joan M. FEDERAL POLICY IN THE SHAPING OF INDIAN OCCUPATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, 1900-1917. Unpublished paper delivered at Western Conference of Asian Studies, November 1974. 17 pp. <br />
</strong>Concentrating on the period of initial immigration, the author shows how the federal government, through a series of legal actions, closed many avenues of economic endeavor to East Indians. The thesis of the paper is that men who came from India to find economic freedom eventually came to be count by a whole network of laws which &ldquo;made them outcastes and imposed a new western caste system on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Dodd, Werter D. &ldquo;Hindu in the Northwes,&rdquo; WORLD TODAY. 13:1 (July 1907), pp. 1157-1160.<br />
</strong>This is a very negative evaluation of the East Indian worker on the Pacific Coast. The Hindu is not considered a race problem, as are the Japanese and Chinese, but an &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; one which will become a substantial factor in labor market competition.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>&ldquo;Anti-Oriental Riots,&rdquo; THE INDEPENDENT. 63:3067 (September 12, 1907), pp. 592-593. <br />
</strong>This news report briefly covers the opposition of American laboring classes to &ldquo;Asiatic immigration,&rdquo; specifically the riots in Vancouver, British Columbia and Bellingham, Washington.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>&ldquo;Asiatics in Vancouver,&rdquo; THE INDEPENDENT. 63:3068 (September 19, 1907), pp. 658-659. <br />
</strong>In a follow-up story to the article above, the situation in British Columbia was viewed as potentially dangerous because antagonism against &ldquo;Asiatic&rdquo; people was increasing and the opposition becoming more organized. The report says that English papers blame the Vancouver riot on Americans, &ldquo;because they set the example in San Francisco and Bellingham&rdquo; and because representatives of the amto-Japanese and Korean League from California and Washington were in British Columbia when the demonstrations broke out.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Singh, Saint Nihal. &ldquo;The Picturesque Immigrant from India&rsquo;s Coral Strand,&rdquo; OUT WEST. 30:1 (January 1909), pp. 42-54.<br />
</strong>Written in a flowery and almost condescending style, Singh describes the appearance, motives and activities of East Indians who had recently migrated to the U.S. from India, Burma, China and the Malaya Straits. He points out the color prejudice which affected many of the darker Indians, the economic deprivation of some workers, and the growing hostility of surrounding communities towards &ldquo;Orientals.&rdquo; He concludes, however, that &ldquo;No Matter what station of life he may belong to, or what culture he may possess, the East Indian immigrant, when he leaves America, takes home with him a dynamic love of liberty and sentiments of democracy.&rdquo; At that time, most East Indians were considered &ldquo;passenger&rdquo; migrants who would someday return to India.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Das, Rejani K. HINDUSTANI WORKERS ON THE PACIFIC COAST. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1923. 126 pp. <br />
</strong>The best general survey of East Indian immigrants on the Pacific Coast for the first two decades of the century, this covers immigration, geographical distribution, occupations, unionism, working conditions, living standards, social life and cultural practices, and problems of prejudice, as well as the barriers to assimilation. Das concludes that although Indians are a small group on the Pacific Coast for the first two decades of the century, this covers immigration, geographical distribution, occupations, unionism, working conditions, living standards, social life and cultural practices, and problems of prejudice as well as the barriers to assimilation. Das concludes that although Indians are a small group on the Pacific Coast, the continuation of discrimination against them might cause India to break commercial relations with the United States.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Mukerji, Dhan Gopal. CASTE AND OUTCASTE. New York: E.P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1923. 303 pp. <br />
</strong>Mukerji, a Hindu Brahman, was a prolific author who often sought to interpret Indian culture to Western audiences. In this book he gives a small glimpse of what life was like for East Indian agricultural laborers &ldquo;in California fields&rdquo; (the title of Chapter IV). As a student, Mukerji himself worked picking various crops such as asparagus, hops, and fruit. He mentions many aspects of migrant life, including the hard drinking, long hours, arduous tasks, and the social bonds formed among East Indian workers. There is an amusing encounter between Salvation Army missionaries and a group of workers in which Mukerji acted as translator. </p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Fernandez, Bonifacio. &ldquo;East Indian Contributions to Agricultural Development in Central California,&rdquo; DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS IN SELECTED CALIFORNIA AREAS. Mimeo, 1953, pp. 130-147.<br />
</strong>This article contains a short review of East Indian migration to California, a discussion of the geographical distribution of East Indians in the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys, and an assessment of the East Indian contribution to rice and cotton farming.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Johns, Watson L. THE HINDU IN CALIFORNIA. Unpublished manuscript, 1941. 12 pp.<br />
</strong>Written as a term paper for an economics course at the University of Oregon, this paper contains almost every stereotype then current. It is included not for its value as a source, but because this paper is often one of the few items found in some smaller California libraries which deals with the East Indian population. Why this particular paper has been so widely circulated is unknown, although the professor in charge rated the paper &ldquo;Very Good.&rdquo; It is a classic case of superficial cultural criticism.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Chandrasekhar, S. &ldquo;Indian Communities in the United States,&rdquo; FAR EASTERN SURVEY. 14:11 (June 6, 1945), pp. 147-149. <br />
</strong>A short historical portrait of the &ldquo;British Indian community of less than 5,000 persons,&rdquo; this article relates the occupational characteristics, the migratory nature of work, and the development of rice cultivation to the agricultural patterns of East Indians in California. The fact that East Indians were then ineligible for citizenship is mentioned.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Miller, Allan P. AN ETHNOGRAPHIC REPORT ON THE SIKH (EAST) INDIANS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY. Manuscript University of California Berkeley, 1950. 148 pp.<br />
</strong>Field work for this paper was conducted in the summer of 1947 and represents the only in-depth ethnographic information which currently exists for the Sikhs in Northern California. Collected at a time when the majority of the East Indians were still single and unable to won land, it provides a baseline for gauging the changes which have occurred since Indian Independence (1948). Divided into ten sections, it covers: Background and Population of the Sikhs of Sacramento Valley; Religion; Economics and Property; Political Organization; Social Life; Crime; Marriage; Food and Eating Habits; Homes; and Funeral Practices.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Dadabhay, Yusuf. &ldquo;Circuitous Assimilation Among Rural Hindustanis in California,&rdquo; SOCIAL FORCES. 33 (December 1954), pp. 138-141.<br />
</strong>Based on a survey of 50 Sikh immigrants, 11 of whom had married Mexican wives, the author posted the theory of &ldquo;circuitous assimilation.&rdquo; His propsitin was that very small ethnic minority (in this case, East Indian) would be assimilated into the &ldquo;American&rdquo; society by being first merged into a larger and better recognized ethinc segment of the country (Mexican American). Further research has failed to prove the validity of this theory, but the data is interesting as a gimpse of a social process which was more of an &ldquo;interlude&rdquo; caused by restrictive immigration laws than a prologue to assimilation.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Jacoby, Harold S. A HALF-CENTURY APPRAISAL OF EAST INDIANS IN THE UNITED STATES. University of the Pacific Faculty Research Lecture, May 23, 1956, Stockton, California. 35 pp.<br />
</strong>Viewed from the perspective of a sociologist, this &ldquo;appraisal&rdquo; seeks to examine the nature of the assimilation process and the way in which it has affected East Indians. Unlike most materials on &ldquo;East Indians&rdquo; which deal primarily with Sikhs, the author covers Pakistani Muslims, Punjabi Sikhs, and Hindus. He divides the migration groups into: &ldquo;Old Timers&rdquo; (1904-1917); Students (1917-1924); Illegal (1920-1930); and Quota Immigrants (1946-Present). Geographic distribution, religion and caste backgrounds are discussed as a preface to more specific examinations of material culture, personal habits, crime and delinquency, food and drink, language and beliefs. The last section discusses the East Indian situation in terms of social integration and amalgamation.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Mayer, Adrian C. A REPORT ON THE EAST INDIAN COMMUNITY IN VANCOUVER. Institute of Social and Economic Research, University of Vancouver, British Columbia, 1959. 39 pp.<br />
</strong>This ethnographic survey of the East Indian (over 90% Sikh) community in Greater Vancouver contains information on the history of settlement, caste, marriage, household and kin groups, village and region of origin, religious activity and the temple, associations, and relationships between the Indian community and Canadian society. This group is seen as an ethnic enclave which is held together by religious and cultural identities but driven internally by factions and assertions of individuality.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Littleton, C. Scott. &ldquo;Some Aspects of Social Stratifications Among the Immigrant Punjabi Communities of California,&rdquo; in CULTURE CHANGE AND STABILITY, Ralph L. Beals (ed.). Publication of the Department of Anthropology, University of California &ndash; Los Angeles, 1964, pp. 105-116.<br />
</strong>This research paper discusses some of the factors contributing to social stratification and the nature of status positions within the Punjabi society of the 1940&rsquo;s and 1950&rsquo;s. Various criterion such as caste background, economic situation, education, and degree of assimilation are noted as important components of status definition. As the author notes, the use of &ldquo;high,&rdquo; &ldquo;middle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;low&rdquo; class as categories is somewhat simplistic although useful in establishing abroad analytical frameworks from a sociological standpoint.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Davids, Leo. &ldquo;The East Indian Family Overseas,&rdquo; SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDEIS. 13:3 (September 1964), pp. 383-394.<br />
</strong>Focusing on changes in family structure, this article compares immigrant marriage patterns in North America, Fiji, the Caribbean Islands, and the Guianas. The author&rsquo;s summary that caste &ldquo;except as an expendable preference, is gone&rdquo; is an overstatement, although he correctly asserts that caste in overseas areas is not as rigid or as all-encompassing as in India.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Jain, Usha R. THE GUJARATIS OF SAN FRANCISCO. M.A.: University of California, Berkeley, 1964. 127 pp.<br />
</strong>This thesis describes a small (22 families) group patel (agricultural caste) Gujuratis who have become successful hotel owners in the Bay Area. Their migration history, religious practices, community and family organization, and attitudes towards American education and social life are noted in some detail. At the time of the study, little intergenerational conflict over cultural ideals was evident and second-generation Gujurati East Indians showed little evidence of assimilation.</p>

</strong>In a general overview of the cultural characteristics of Punjabi Sikhs and their present circumstances in the Sutter County area, Wenzel includes material on immigration and legal controls, economic activities, family life, politics, Indian nationalism, associations, and religious activities. He stresses the close relationship between the Sikh religion and individual Punjabi character. (Condensations of this work are available as &ldquo;The Sikhs of Sutter County,&rdquo; <em>Sikh Sansar</em>, 1:4 (December 1972), pp. 115-121 and &ldquo;The East Indians of Sutter County,&rdquo; <em>The North State Review</em>, 3:1 (April 1968), Chico: Chico State College, pp. 15-25).</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Greenwood, Lenoard. &ldquo;El Centro&rsquo;s Community of Sikhs Dying Out,&rdquo; LOS ANGELES TIMES. Part 2 (December 28, 1966), p. 1.<br />
</strong>Greenwood traces the early struggles of the Sikhs who settled in the Imperial Valley, including family separations, immigration bans, legal battles and discrimination. The community faces cultural extinction because only the old people are staying in the area, the younger Sikhs moving either to the cities (Los Angeles and San Francisco) or to other East Indian communities, such as Yuba City and Stockton.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Chakravorti, Robindra C. THE SIKHS OF EL CENTRO: A STUDY IN SOCIAL INTEGRATION. Ph.D.: University of Minnesota, 1968. 150 pp.<br />
</strong>The author conducted a sociological study of the process of social integration of Sikh immigrants from India settled in and around El Centro (Imperial Valley), California. Within the theoretical framework of a modified version of Park&rsquo;s theory of assimilation, the author found significant differences between India-born and American-born Sikhs in the degree of assimilation and accommodation. He concludes that the relative size of the minority group and its will to maintain its subsystem are two key variables that may determine the nature and rapidity of the process of integration. The dissertation includes an informative chapter on the social life and institutions of El Centro Sikhs. </p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Gupta, Santosh Prabha. THE ACCULTURATION OF ASIAN INDIANS IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA. Ph.D.: Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, 1969. 219 pp. <br />
</strong>The data for this study was gathered through library research, participant observation, and informal interviewing of 50 East Indians, primarily Hindus, living in Central Pennsylvania. Gupta suggests that acculturation in religious practices and food habits is occurring rapidly while attitudes towards social life, marriage, and kinship obligations are most resistant to change. Stages of adjustment to American society are characterized as: &ldquo;Period of Antagonism and Cultural Curiosity&rdquo; lasting a year or so; &ldquo;Period of Agreement and Adoption&rdquo; lasting from two to five years; and &ldquo;The Period of Cultural Stability&rdquo; beginning after five to ten years of residence in the United States. This is one of the few recent acculturation studies of East Indians in the United States and the only one dealing with Indian residents of Pennsylvania other than students. </p>
<p class="style2"><strong>Bradfield, Helen Haynes. THE EAST INDIANS OF YUBA CITY: A STUDY IN ACCULTURATION. M.A.: Sacramento State College, 1971. 133 pp.<br />
</strong>The thesis is a study of the mechanisms inhibiting or assisting acculturation of Sikhs in the Sutter County area of the Sacramento Valley. Based in large part on an analysis of the applicability of Milton Gordon&rsquo;s theory of &ldquo;structural pluralism,&rdquo; the research covers a broad spectrum of topics, including a description of the study area, history of the Sikhs, religious practices, political factionalism, and the generational differences in perceptions and social activities. A short section deals with the attitudes of the larger community towards East Indians.</p>

</strong>The authors claim there are 50,000 Indians and Pakistanis in New York, many of them in professional, industrial and governmental positions. According to them, unlike earlier European and Asian migrants, the majority of East Indians are educated and affluent. They have for the most part retained not only their cultural identity, but actively participate in Indian religious, social and artistic events. </p>

</strong>This is an excellent article which details the changes that heave occurred in Sikh family structure and roles. Comparisons are made between Canadian patterns, traditional Indian models, and ideal Canadian-Sikh family patters. A high degree of persistence was found in religion, marriage, and age and sex-based on differentiation patterns, while changes in family type, economic allocation of resources, political allocation of authority, and education were found.</p>

Since the adoption of Sikhism by Westerners is a recent (post-1969) phenomenon in America, the conclusion that the orthodox stance of the new converts is exaggerating divisions within the Punjabi community is tentatively offered. The main point is that Sikhism, as a religion, has ceased to be a provincial faith associated exclusively with Punjabi South Asians.</p>

</strong>A factitious account of the Bellingham riots, this article speculates on their possible effect upon diplomatic relations with Great Britain. Noting that some people warned that the wrecking of a Japanese restaurant in San Francisco might bring war with Japan closer, the article seeks to equate running Sikhs out of Washington state as being a situation which might lead to a confrontation with England. The idea is rejected as ridiculous.</p>

A shift from initial suspicion and hostility towards the nationalists to partial acceptance of their argument on the right to self-government is noted. Although not directly related to the East Indian experience in America, this dissertation does reveal the general attitudes of the United States government towards South Asian nationalists at a time when U.S. Ghadar activities were at their height, immigration restrictions on East Indians were being contemplated, and the Alien Land Act was passed.

The British concern for internal security and preservation of colonial rule in India often coincided with American exclusionist forces, anti-Asian labor movements, and popular racist attitudes. The result was the halting of East Indian immigration to America in 1917, denial of citizenship in 1923, and numerous deportations; all such actions were approved by the British.</p>

</strong>One major source of American&rsquo;s images of India are public school textbooks. The textbooks are also one of many indices which reflect changing attitudes and illuminate the fluctuating social climate which affected East Indian migrants to North America. In this study, seventy-two geographies and histories were reviewed to determine how closely their portrayals of India coincided with three major periods of Indo-American relations; Gadhian movements of Non-Cooperation, World War II, and Indian Independence. The conclusion is that treatment of India in American texts had paralleled that of political relations in general. The most biased pro-British content is evident in the books published in the 1920&rsquo;s and the 1930&rsquo;s while more balanced and accurate materials become available between 1948-1952. This study was updated in 1969 by Prakash V. Duggal in his Ph.D. dissertation, <em>The treatment of India in Selected American Social Studies Textbooks,</em> 1953-1968. University of Michigan, 1969. 304 pp. His main conclusions are that approaches to world history have become more anthropological and cultural rather than purely historical or chronological and that authors tend to be more analytical.</p>

</strong>Drawing from the school populations of the Yuba City-Marysville area, the author selected a total of 30 students of East Indian (Sikh) parents and divided them into two groups: those born in India and those born in the United States. Data was gathered through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. The hypothesis that American &ndash;born students would take a more active part in social activities of the wider society than India-born students was partially confirmed, although their value orientations were not found to be significantly different from their parents. Language facility is seen as an important variable which can retard or accelerate contracts outside the East Indian peer group.</p>

The instrument used is a modification of Florence R. Kluckhohns&rsquo;s interviews schedule which included Spanish-Americans, Texans, Mormons, Zuni and Navaho. The sample included East Indian students between the ages of fourteen and twenty and their parents (52 students and 62 parents). The value orientations and the relationship between other variables, such as age, sex, amount of material culture, and length of residence in the United States, are noted. The results indicate that there are no great or significant disparities in the values of different segments of the East Indian population in the Sutter County area, except in the time orientation; the younger generation being present oriented, while their parents are future oriented. </p>

</strong>Based on questionnaires distributed to East Indian students attending Yuba College (Yuba County, California) and schools in the Yuba City Unified School District (Sutter County California), the author gathered material in the areas of external ethnic customs, social interaction patterns, and assimilation of values and norms. A Fijian East Indian himself, he sought to test the hypothesis that the first American-born generation would be a generation of change. He concludes that within the Sikh community of Yuba City Marysville, the second generation has not experienced the degree of social or psychological change associated with European or Oriental immigrant populations elsewhere, as they &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; responses are nearly equal in both Indian-born and American-born respondents. </p>

His indices of change included dietary habits, clothing styles and personal adornment, use of English, recreation patters, religious practices, social interaction, attitudes towards marriage and family structure, and personal identification. He concludes that acculturation of adults and children is minimal and therefore the home is &ldquo;not the most desirable place to find support for the children&rsquo;s acculturation.&rdquo; Solanki sees the schools as providing the greatest opportunities for inducing social change among East Indian youth.</p>

</strong>The author, a teacher and long time resident of the Northern Sacramento Valley, conducted a survey among Sikh women students at Yuba College in an attempt to elicit their needs and desires as related to the institution. The implicit concern of the study was to uncover areas in which the institution could assist assimilation. Equally implicit was the belief that endogamy or &ldquo;arranged marriages within the ethnic group&rdquo; was a deterrent to social integration. Her conclusions includes the recommendation that the social contacts of Sikh women be enlarged through more participation in college activities and other acceptable social functions. In this way, the isolation which characterizes the East Indian population in the Yuba Sutter County areas could be somewhat alleviated. </p>

</strong>This article is one of several concerning East Indians which grew out of a program sponsored by the Committee on Cross-Cultural Education of the Social Science Research Council. Here the focus is on three types of cultural reference which Indian students bring to bear on their American experiences: family practices, political behavior, and race relations. One result of the study was to uncover &ldquo;sensitive area complexes&rdquo; or topics which when raised by an American, cause the Indian student to react negatively both to the individual and the United States. The authors feel that, &ldquo;If confirmed by subsequent research, the implication of this thesis is that so long as Indian students and visitors from other &lsquo;low-status&rsquo; countries correctly or incorrectly perceive that Americans hold and unfavorable image of their home countries, even extravagantly favorable assessments of American life will be largely irrelevant to the formation of &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; attitudes toward the United States. This &ldquo;sensitive area&rdquo; idea is applicable not only to transient East Indian students but to immigrant and native-born East Indian students attending American educational institutions.</p>

Using intensive interviews and elaborate questionnaires, the differences between life styles in America and the various &ldquo;roles&rdquo; that Indian students elect or are expected to play are explored. Various aspects of the students&rsquo; experience as &ldquo;student,&rdquo; &ldquo;tourist,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ambassador of a foreign culture&rdquo; are examined in detail. IN some sense, the roles of tourist and ambassador are shared by all East Indians who come to America, whether as students or as permanent residents.</p>

</strong>Combining case histories, interview schedules and observations, the author has examined 60 East Indian students&rsquo; perceptions of America. He found four phases: first, the &ldquo;arrival&rdquo; period of tension and the difficulties of presenting the &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; point of view, which lasts approximately a week; the second phase, lasting from three to nine months during which the student becomes disillusioned with American life and more critical of U.S. cultural values; the third period is a time of increasing acculturation and broader outlooks and lists from 18 to 36 months; the fourth phase, beginning after four years, marks a gradual depoliticization and an attempt to avoid alienation in the host society. Since many Indian students do remain in the United States after their education, and a large number eventually become citizens, this study has important implications for understanding East Indian reactions to American society. </p>

</strong>Selim examines the reaction of Pakistani students to their experiences in American colleges and universities. The finings show that students generally feel that their colleges are indifferent to their needs and to the necessity and importance of orientation programs for foreign students. Most students perceive valuable charges in their philosophy and outlook, some becoming more critical of American culture as a result of residence here. Many felt that aspects of the United States higher education system, such as quarter or semester systems, the use of objective test, and student counseling services, should be introduced in Pakistani colleges.</p>

</strong>Through a series of interviews with Indian students attending the University of Wisconsin, the author sought to determine if a study tour in the United States improved their attitudes towards the U.S. government and its foreign policy goals. The underlying motive was to test the effectiveness of educational exchange programs as an instrument of American diplomacy. The findings showed that rather than changing preconceived ides, the East Indian students who were attracted to such programs already held favorable images of the United States. There was no clear relation between the level of political knowledge and the direction of the student&rsquo;s political attitudes. It was concluded that educational exchange policy succeeds by reinforcing positive images already held by pro-American Indian students, not through changing negative opinions.</p>

</strong>Based on an examination of the concept of &ldquo;community&rdquo; as a &ldquo;total way of life which need not be anchored to a restricted territory,&rdquo; this sociological study was conducted among East Indian students (150-200 persons) who comprise a &ldquo;little India&rdquo; on a Midwestern college campus. The theory stated that polarization would occur within this group due to a division between &ldquo;locals&rdquo; who adhere to the past and those who actively embrace the future (cosmopolitans). Such a split was interpreted as a micro-cosmic refection of the situation in Greater South Asian India. The description of Little India as a &ldquo;unique ethnic-status community internally polarized between locals (who are inner-community and tradition oriented) and cosmopolitans (who are extra-community and scientific-industrial oriented)&rdquo;, as directly applicable to many contemporary East Indian communities in the United States.</span></p>

</strong>The author considers a decision by East Indian students not to return to India after advanced academic straining an important type of immigration behavior. The study was conducted among those who had made the decision to remain in the United States some years before. It was found that married respondents with master&rsquo;s or higher degrees decided to return to India more often than respondents who were unmarried and had a bachelor&rsquo;s degree from India. This study, although conducted only a few years ago, is related to the entire process of East Indian migrate to America because throughout the last 70 years, thousands of students have and continue to, take up U.S. residency. Historically, this has meant the continual presence of highly educated East Indians who have often acted as representatives and leaders of their communities. Socially, this group is the most urbane and have adapted to American society with a minimum of conflict.</p>
