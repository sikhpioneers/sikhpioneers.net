<p>From the Punjab to the Smithsonian<br>
  by: Harbhajan Singh ‘Bhaji' </p>
<p>July 24, 2004<br>
Washington, D.C. </p>
<p>Some hundred years ago, people came here from Punjab,<br>
  Bringing with them their dreams and little trunks of belongings.<br>
  They hoped that they would work here a few years<br>
  And return with pockets full.<br>
  <br>
  Some labored in the fields, some worked on the lumber chains,<br>
  And shared each others' joys and pains collectively.<br>
  People hated them, calling them “Rag-heads” and “Hindoo-men.”<br>
  If they ventured out on their own, hooligans would seek to fight them.<br>
  <br>
  Some worked in the field and sold the vegetables;<br>
  In San Joaquin, people like Jawala Singh and Visakha Singh became potato kings.<br>
  When they felt secure and confident, they recovered a sense of self;<br>
  They built their first Gurdwara in Stockton on their twenty-five cent wages.<br>
  <br>
  Living in a land of liberty, they came to realize<br>
  That the life of a slave is worthless, and decided to work for freedom.<br>
  They raised the slogan of rebellion to make Hindustan [India] free;<br>
&nbsp; Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims came together to make a heaven on earth.<br>
  <br>
  When they returned home, a hail of bullets greeted them<br>
  None of their kin received their bodies, no one could cry over them.<br>
  Those captured were sent into exile,<br>
  Never to meet their comrades again.<br>
  <br>
  Whites ruled India, without right to do so;<br>
  Why should foreigners control another's country?<br>
  One Pakhar Singh challenged with a legal battle,<br>
  But denied justice, resorted to the gun.<br>
  <br>
  Yet in America, Dalip Singh Saundh became the first Sikh elected to Congress<br>
  And fought relentlessly for human rights.<br>
  They [Sikh immigrants] slept under open skies to ensure the roofs now over our heads.<br>
  The fragrance of such noble deeds perfumes our joy and prosperity today.<br>
  <br>
  They became Everyman-kings: peach kings, raisin kings, hard-working gas-station kings;<br>
  Some became doctors, engineers, scientists, now employing others with pride.<br>
  <br>
  Now we just hop on a plane and come over;<br>
  They opened the way for us:<br>
  Not even God will forgive us if we forget the great men.<br>
  <br>
  We owe our present joys to the self sacrifice<br>
  Of those who wasted their youth some hundred years ago.<br>
  They surely forgot the fields and meadows of the old villages of their home,<br>
  Surely their departed souls rejoice now, seeing us gathered here today.<br>
  <br>
  Such an arduous journey, now arrived from the Punjab to the Smithsonian:<br>
  Yet true equality remains unattained; innocent people like Sodhi are still killed.<br>
  We have come a very long way, still striving for further goals;<br>
  We languish still behind other communities.<br>
  <br>
  This caravan that left the Punjab a century ago, may find another stopping place<br>
  Even at the White House, for some descendant of this land of five rivers.</p>
