<h3>Gadar Party - Background</h3>
<p>
        The word GADAR or GHADAR means revolt or rebellion.  The GADAR
movement was a revolt against the British rule in India and it was started
and organized by the Indian immigrants to Canada and the United States of
America.  It was not the result of efforts of any one man or a group.  It
was the result of the general and natural reaction of the political,
social, and economic conditions that prevailed in India in about the year 
1904, and on the minds of the brave and courageous of Punjab. 
 They were hard pressed by the adverse economic conditions
prevailing in the Punjab at that time to earn their
livelihood. 
<p>
These immigrants were adventurous
and hardy people.  They worked hard, got good wages and did very well in
these new countries.  They saw the American people upholding the American
Declaration of Independence of 4th of July 1776, establishing the right of
freedom and liberty of every human being in the political, social, and
economic field.  The Indian mind was thus charged with this feeling of
freedom and consequently they wanted to get rid of the foreign rule in
their own country.  This rise in the consciousness of the Indian people
was admired by the American people but the Canadian people did not like it
because in Canada, the British and the French formed the main bulk of the
people.
<p> 
        But in the days of economic depression in the United States the
white laborers began to think that the economic depression was mainly due
to the inflow of the hard working laboring class of the Asians.  So they
began to ill treat them.  There were riots and the Asians, i.e., Indians,
Japanese, Chinese, suffered life and property losses.  Whereas the
Japanese and Chinese governments worked with the American government to
make good the losses of the Japanese and Chinese sufferers respectively,
the British India Government did not show any interest.  This further
strengthened Indian's urge to free their Country from the foreign Yoke.
<p>
        In 1908, in Seattle (Washington) Mr. Tarak Nath, started a monthly
magazine named "Free India" under the management of a Bengali exile
Surinder Mohan Bose.  This magazine advocated armed rebellion against the
British rule in India.  Mr. Tarak Nath also formed "East India
Association" in 1911.  Similarly in Oregon State too, a meeting of the
Indians was held at Portland in 1912 at which "The Hindustani Association"
was formed and it was also decided there to start an URDU weekly
newspaper, "The India." 
<p>
        In Oregon a meeting of the Indians was held in Portland in
1912 at which the Hindustani Association was formed which ultimately
turned into GADAR PARTY.  Sohn Singh Bhakna and Bhai Udham Singh Kasel
were laid off from their jobs and they went to Astoria, Oregon to see
their friend Bhai Kesar Singh.
<p>
        There a branch of the party was opened with Bhai Kesar Singh,
Munshi Karim Bakhsh and Shri Munshi Ram as President, Secretary and
Treasurer respectively.  Only five or six meetings were held when G. D.
Kumar, who was to start an Urdu weekly paper "The India", fell sick and
the paper could not be started.  During this time Lala Tkakar Dass (Dhuri)
came to Portland to see Sohan Singh Bhakna and Kanshii Ram and advised
them to send for Lala Hardyal and entrust him the work of running the
paper and Lala Hardyal also agreed to it. 
He however, along with Bhai
Parmanand reached St. John, Oregon in the last week of March, 1913.  A
meeting of the Association was called and representatives from other
cities were invited to attend.  It was decided in the meeting that the
Hindustani Association's branches should be Headquartered in San Francisco
California. Plans were also made to open branches in other additional
cities.
<p>
  The
office Headquarters at San Francisco was to be named as "GADAR ASHRAM" or
"UGANTER ASHRAM."  And the party to be known as "Hindi Association of the
Pacific Coast."  The other important decision of the meeting was to use
force to overthrow the foreign rule in India.  The earlier aims of industrial and
agricultural development and education and ending of foreign exploitation
in India gave place to one single aim of ending foreign rule through
force.  At the end of the meeting, the following resolutions were
adopted:
<p>
1. The organization be named as "Hindi Association of the Pacific Coast;"<br>
2. The aim of the Association will be to end the British rule of India<br>
through violent means and armed rebellion and to establish a Republic based
on freedom and equality;<br>
3.  The Head office of the Association will be at San Francisco
California which is a port and a center of rebels of foreign countries;<br>
4. The Association will publish a weekly paper "The GADAR," in Urdu, Punjabi,
Hindi, and other languages;<br>
5. The election of the Association will take place annually;<br>
<p>
        In almost every country there existed a branch or branches of the
GADAR PARTY.  Whereas in countries, other than those British-ruled,
these branches were working openly, in British-ruled countries they worked underground.

<h3>Causes of the failure of the Gadar Party: </h3>
<br>
the causes of the failure of the Gadar Party
 are many but some of them are as follows:
<p>
1. The party was only one and half years old and was not fully established
when the first World War broke out in 1914 and the Ghardrites had to
declare war against the British rule in India without full preparation.
<p>

2. The Gadrites who had hurried homeward from America and other places
were under the impression that the conditions in India were ripe for
revolution but this was not true.  Indian National Congress, Chief Khalsa
Diwan (an organization of the Sikhs) Mahatma Gandhi, B. J. Tilak, etc.
were in sympathy with the British cause in the war.  The Punjabis were
getting themselves recruited and fighting on the front.  Prayers were
performed in Gurdwaras, temples, mosques for the victory of the Britisd.  
<p>
3. The leaders of the Gadar Party were arrested the very moment they
placed their feet on the Indian soil; it broke the backbone of the party.
<p>
4. Moreover, the arms and ammunitions which were to be received from
outside countries could not reach India just like the supply loaded from
San Diego (California) on 'Anlarson' was seized on the way.
<p>
5.  Mr. Kirpal Singh's admission into the inner committee of Mr. Sarat
Chandra Bose, directing the Gadar movement, was a mistake; as it was he who
passed on every piece of information of the Gadar party to the British government
including the date of rebellion.

<i>Originally published in GADAR, a Newsletter  of the Gadar Memorial Center, 5 Wood Street, San
Francisco, CA 94117   November/December 1992
<p>
(This is part I of an article translated from a Punjabi originally written
by Sardar Bhagat Singh.  Kartar Singh Sarabha began his involvement in the
Gadar Party in San Francisco in 1912.  Part II will be published in the
next issue)</i>
<p>
Revolutionary Kartar Singh, the great devotee of Bellona, the goddess of
war, was not even twenty years old when he sacrificed himself on the altar
of goddess of freedom.  He appeared like a storm from somewhere, ignited
the flame of revolution and tried to wake up the sleeping Bellona.  He
blazed the holy yajna of revolution and became himself an offering for the
same.  Who was he? From what world did he suddenly appear?  And where did
he go?  We were awestruck.  Such courage, self-confidence, and dedication
is rarely found.  Few persons have been born in India who can be called
revolutionary in true sense of the word.  Kartar Singh's name comes at the
top among these few.  Revolution lived in his veins.  There was only one
aim of his life, only one desire, only one hope - all that held meaning in
his life was revolution.
<p>
Kartar Singh was born in Sarabha, a village in district Ludhiana, in 1896.
He was the only son of his parents.  He was still very young when his
father died.  His grandfather brought him up with great care.  After
passing the ninth grade, he went to Orissa to live with his uncle.  He
completed his high school and began college while there.  It was the year
1910-1911, when he had the opportunity to read a lot of books outside the
narrow range of school or college text books.  This was also the time of
nationalist movement.  It was this political environment that aroused the
feeling of patriotism in him.  It was then that he decided that he must
travel to America.
<p>
The family did not have any opposition to that.  He arrived in San
Francisco in 1912.  Having arrived in the "free nation" his tender heart
was subjected to blows and humiliation at every step.  He would be very
upset when he heard himself being called a damn Hindu or black man by the
whites.  At every step he felt his country's dignity and respect in
jeopardy.  With the constant memory of home, he also visualized India -
helpless and in chains.  His tender heart began to harden gradually and
his determination to sacrifice his life for the freedom of country began
to become firm.
<p>
It was impossible for him to remain calm.  The question began to haunt
him.  How would the country become free if peaceful means failed.  Without
wasting much time in thinking, he began to organize Indian laborers.
Passion for freedom began to grow in them.  He would sit with a worker for
hours and explain to him how death is thousand times preferable to life of
slavery filled with humiliation.  Many persons joined him when the work
progressed.  A special meeting of these people took place in May 1912.  A
few selected Indians attended that meeting.  All of them took vow to
dedicate their mind, body and wealth for the freedom of their country.
Meantime the exiled Punjabi patriot Bhagwan Singh reached there.  Meetings
began to take place in a great number.
<p>
Intensive teaching became the name work increased.  The field was
prepared.  Then the need for a paper was felt.  A paper named GADAR was
launched.  Its first issue was published in November 1913.  Kartar
Singh was also a member of its editorial board.  Members of the editorial
board printed the paper on a hand press.
<p>
Kartar Singh was a carefree young man who loved revolution.  The
dedication with which Kartar Singh worked gave courage to all others.
Whether anyone else knew how to make India free or not, whether anyone
else ever thought about it or not, Kartar Singh had given a lot of
thought.  In the meantime he joined an institute in New York to learn how
to fly a plane and began his mission there wholeheartedly.
<p>
In September 1914 Kama Gata Maru ship had to return without unloading its
human cargo after its passenger suffered indescribable tortures at the
hand of the imperialist whites.  So Kartar Singh along with Kranti Priya
Gupta and an American anarchist Jack went to Japan.  He met Baba Gurdit
Singh in Kobe and held consultations with him.  From Yugantar Ashram, San
Francisco, copies of the Gadar, Gadar ki Gunj and many other publications
were printed and distributed regularly.  Propaganda increased every day.
Enthusiasm stayed high.  In a public meeting held in Stockton in February
1914, Indian freedom flag was unfurled.  Oaths for freedom and equality
were taken.  Kartar Singh was one of the main speakers in this meeting.
All the people present there declared that they would give all of their
hard earned money for the struggle for country's freedom.
