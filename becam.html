One of the major goals of the Punjabi American Heritage Society is to promote friendship and understanding amongst all people.  In an effort to meet/expand this goal, the Punjabi American Heritage Society, in partnership with the Sutter County Community Museum, is currently in the process of planning a permanent exhibit to showcase the story of migration of the Punjabi Americans to the United States of America over the last century. This exhibit will provide a wealth of information in an effort to educate the public at large.  It will also include the contributions of Punjabi Americans to mainstream society, culture, faith, and heritage.  It is our hope that the exhibit will serve as a source of information to students, teacher and any other visitor to the museum. In order to accomplish our goal of completing this exhibit, we are in need of input, support, and funds from the community.
<br><br>
Another phase of this project will include the publishing of a book, "Becoming American".  To put together a comprehensive and professional book, we will be hiring scholars and authors.  In addition to the story behind the migration experience, this book will provide a summary of the museum exhibit and recognize sponsors and donors of this project.
