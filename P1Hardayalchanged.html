<p><strong></strong>Since the time of Lala Hay Dayal jumped bail and left the United States in 1914, he continued his work from Geneva and Berlin . When the whole operations of these Ghadarites were frustrated with the United States joining the allied in war in April 1917, and consequently arresting all those leading German and Indian trouble-makers for violating the Neutrality Act, Har Dayal too thought it wise to leave for Sweden from Germany and from then on he took the side of the British as though wisdom had dawned in him for the first time. He held that: </p>
<p>“ India must first move into the twentieth century before self rule would be meaningful and that the necessary moral, spiritual and intellectual transformation could best take place under British protection and suzerainty.” </p>
<p>Many people including C.F. Andrews had held Har Dayal in esteem as a great intellectual but neither his work during 1912 to 1917, or books written by him thereafter, reveal him as such. He was a revolutionary who “ended a most promising life in complete frustration.” In his heydays he talked a lot and he knew many languages and he to had the German patronage, and other than that he seemed to have been a glorified man. His idea of dissociation or passive abstinence from helping the British administration was likened to Gandhi's non cooperation, but neither of these theories were originated by those men. The politicians in England had practiced all that long back in the last century. </p>
<p>Har Dayal's biographer might class him with Subhas Chandra Bose who also agitated for his country's freedom from the foreign soil, but history has proved, and they themselves realized, that theirs was a wrong step. Nonetheless, like Subhas Bose, Har Dayal too had suffered believing what he was doing for the country was the right one, and long before he died in 1939, he had to admit with bitter frustration that he had “finished with political activity of all kinds.” </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>“Don't Tempt Fate,” he Said: </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Har Dayal had become a man more matured and sane after about 1920 although his followers were still thinking that he was anti-British and anti-imperialist, which we was not! Har Dayal had rightly realized that it was wiser for the people to see that the British stayed in India, and, in that he set out in the footsteps of the earlier patriots like Ranada, Gokhale, Phirozshah Mehta and others. Har Dayal knew that most of the men in the Ghadar party were selfish and that they were there only to make a career in the name of being revolutionaries at the cost of the German money. He said that: </p>
<p>“Breaking up the British empire in Asia would lead only to change of masters. Imperialism is an evil, but the British and French imperialism in its worst forms is a thousand times preferable to the German of Japanese imperialism.” </p>
<p>Har Dayal shrewdly looked into the future, and added that: </p>
<p>“It is the part of wisdom for us not to tempt fate but to stay under the protection of the British fleet and arms in our quiet and sunny home of Hidustan, and to make the best of our position in our Empire.” </p>
<p>Har Dayal also waxed eloquent over the quality and blessings of English literature: </p>
<p>“No Oriental nation would be loser if it forgot its own tongue and learned English instead… A primer of English history was worth more than all the histories of Asia.” </p>
