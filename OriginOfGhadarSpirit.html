<p class="style2">Substantially all the participants of the Ghadar Movement were Punjabis and a vast majority of them were Sikhs. One cannot help but notice the stupendous contributions of the Sikhs towards the Indian Independence movement &ndash; contributions gross in excess of their relative population in India.</p>
<p class="style2"> People frequently enquire as to how the burning desire for freedom was kindled in the Sikh race. The answer to this question can be fund through a cursory glance at the Sikh history and philosophy.</p>
<p class="style2"> The spirit of supreme sacrifice in the name of God, human dignity and freedom was initiated first by the fifth Guru, Guru Arjan Dev Ji, builder of the Golden Temple. In his martyrdom lies the beginning of a chain reaction which has persisted and blossomed over the centuries of Sikh history &ndash; and in his own words:</p>
<blockquote class="style2">
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Accept first to die <br>
    Abandon hope of living <br>
    Be dust under the feel of all,<br>
    </em>Then come to me</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> Rag Maur, Var, page 1103.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class="style2">The next glaring event is the martyrdom of the ninth Guru, Guru Teg Bahadur, who strove against Aurangzeb&rsquo;s challenge to exterminate all religions but his own. This great Teacher/Martyr was publicly beheaded in Delhi in 1675 and left us with this inspiring though.</p>
<blockquote class="style2">
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Who frighteneth none, <br>
    Nor himself feareth any, <br>
    Such a man, saith Nanak, <br>
    Set him among the Wise!</em></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Slok, 16; page 1427.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class="style2">The flame erupted into a volcano when the tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, the creator of the Khalsa, Father of India&rsquo;s Independence Movement, Statesman and a soldier, the Saint/Poet taught us to pray &hellip;</p>
<blockquote class="style2">
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Grant me this boon, <br>
    O God, from Thy Greatness, <br>
    May I never refrain <br>
    From righteous acts; <br>
    May I fight without fear <br>
All foes in life&rsquo;s battle, <br>
    With confident courage <br>
    Claiming the victory! <br>
    May my highest ambition be <br>
    Singing Thy praises, <br>
    And may Thy Glory be <br>
    Grained in my mind! <br>
    When this mortal life <br>
    Reaches its limits, <br>
    May I die fighting <br>
    With limitless courage! </em></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Epilogue to Chandi Chariter, 1.</p>

<p class="style2">And no doubt it was exemplified through the life of his father, Guru Teg Bahadur, his own and the martyrdom of his four young sons.</p>
<p class="style2"> It is interesting to witness the commentary of a Western scholar on the legacy of Guru Gobind Singh&hellip;</p>
<p class="style2"><em>When Guru Gobind Singh inaugurated the sacrament of steel he proved himself a wise and far-sighted leader. For of all material things which genius has inspired with spiritual significance, steel is the truest and most uncompromising. Let humanitarians prate as they will, there never has been a race who have not been purged and refined by it. In some it is the only combater of grossness and the monster of self. To the Khalsa it gave a cause and welded them into a nation; and in the dark days of Muhammadan rule in the middle of the eighteenth century, when the Sikh was slain at sight and no quarter was given, it drove them on those gallant crusades in which they rode to Amritsar in the dead of night, leapt into sacred tank and out again, and galloped back through the enemies&rsquo; lines purified. Hundreds were slain, but not one abjured his faith or perjured his soul to preserve &lsquo;his muddy vesture of decay&rsquo;. </em></p>
