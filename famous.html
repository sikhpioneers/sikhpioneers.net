<h3>Gadar Party - Background</h3>

<p>The word GADAR or GHADAR means revolt or rebellion. The GADAR Party was a
revolt against the British rule in India and it was started and organized by
the Indian immigrants to Canada and the United States of America. It was not
the result of efforts of any one man or a group. It was the result of the
general and natural reaction of the political, social, and economic conditions
that prevailed in India in about the year 1904, and on the minds of the brave
and courageous of Punjab. They were hard pressed by the adverse economic
conditions prevailing in the Punjab at that time to earn their livelihood. </p>

<p>These immigrants were adventurous and hardy people. They worked hard, got good
wages and did very well in these new countries. They saw the American people
upholding the American Declaration of Independence of 4th of July 1776,
establishing the right of freedom and liberty of every human being in the
political, social, and economic field. The Indian mind was thus charged with
this feeling of freedom and consequently they wanted to get rid of the foreign
rule in their own country. This rise in the consciousness of the Indian people
was admired by the American people but the Canadian people did not like it
because in Canada, the British and the French formed the main bulk of the
people. </p>

<p>But in the days of economic depression in the United States the white
laborers began to think that the economic depression was mainly due to the inflow
of the hard working laboring class of the Asians. So they began to ill treat
them. There were riots and the Asians, i.e., Indians, Japanese, Chinese,
suffered life and property losses. Whereas the Japanese and Chinese governments
worked with the American government to make good the losses of the Japanese and
Chinese sufferers respectively, the British India Government did not show any
interest. This further strengthened Indian's urge to free their Country from
the foreign Yoke. </p>

<p>In 1908, in Seattle (Washington) Mr. Tarak Nath, started a monthly magazine
named &quot;Free India&quot; under the management of a Bengali exile Surinder
Mohan Bose. This magazine advocated armed rebellion against the British rule in
India. Mr. Tarak Nath also formed &quot;East India Association&quot; in 1911.
Similarly in Oregon State too, a meeting of the Indians was held at Portland in
1912 at which &quot;The Hindustani Association&quot; was formed and it was also
decided there to start an URDU weekly newspaper, &quot;The India.&quot; </p>

<p>In Oregon a meeting of the Indians was held in Portland in 1912 at which the
Hindustani Association was formed which ultimately turned into GADAR PARTY.
Sohn Singh Bhakna and Bhai Udham Singh Kasel were laid off from their jobs and
they went to Astoria, Oregon to see their friend Bhai Kesar Singh. </p>

<p>There a branch of the party was opened with Bhai Kesar Singh, Munshi Karim
Bakhsh and Shri Munshi Ram as President, Secretary and Treasurer respectively.
Only five or six meetings were held when G. D. Kumar, who was to start an Urdu
weekly paper &quot;The India&quot;, fell sick and the paper could not be
started. During this time Lala Tkakar Dass (Dhuri) came to Portland to see
Sohan Singh Bhakna and Kanshii Ram and advised them to send for Lala Hardyal
and entrust him the work of running the paper and Lala Hardyal also agreed to
it. He however, along with Bhai Parmanand reached St. John, Oregon in the last
week of March, 1913. A meeting of the Association was called and
representatives from other cities were invited to attend. It was decided in the
meeting that the Hindustani Association's branches should be Headquartered in
San Francisco California. Plans were also made to open branches in other
additional cities. </p>

<p>The office Headquarters at San Francisco was to be named as &quot;GADAR
ASHRAM&quot; or &quot;UGANTER ASHRAM.&quot; And the party to be known as
&quot;Hindi Association of the Pacific Coast.&quot; The other important
decision of the meeting was to use force to overthrow the foreign rule in
India. The earlier aims of industrial and agricultural development and
education and ending of foreign exploitation in India gave place to one single
aim of ending foreign rule through force. At the end of the meeting, the
following resolutions were adopted: </p>

<p>1. The organization be named as &quot;Hindi Association of the Pacific
Coast;&quot;<br>
2. The aim of the Association will be to end the British rule of India<br>
through violent means and armed rebellion and to establish a Republic based on
freedom and equality;<br>
3. The Head office of the Association will be at San Francisco California which
is a port and a center of rebels of foreign countries;<br>
4. The Association will publish a weekly paper &quot;The GADAR,&quot; in Urdu,
Punjabi, Hindi, and other languages;<br>
5. The election of the Association will take place annually;</p>

<p>In almost every country there existed a branch or branches of the GADAR
PARTY. Whereas in countries, other than those British-ruled, these branches
were working openly, in British-ruled countries they worked underground. </p>

  -->Causes of the failure of the Gadar Party: </h3>

<P><br>
the causes of the failure of the Gadar Party are many but some of them are as
follows: </p>

<p>1. The party was only one and half years old and was not fully established
when the first World War broke out in 1914 and the Ghardrites had to declare war
against the British rule in India without full preparation. </p>

<p>2. The Gadrites who had hurried homeward from America and other places were
under the impression that the conditions in India were ripe for revolution but
this was not true. Indian National Congress, Chief Khalsa Diwan (an
organization of the Sikhs) Mahatma Gandhi, B. J. Tilak, etc. were in sympathy
with the British cause in the war. The Punjabis were getting themselves
recruited and fighting on the front. Prayers were performed in Gurdwaras, temples,
mosques for the victory of the British. </p>

<p>3. The leaders of the Gadar Party were arrested the very moment they placed
their feet on the Indian soil; it broke the backbone of the party. </p>

<p>4. Moreover, the arms and ammunitions which were to be received from outside
countries could not reach India just like the supply loaded from San Diego
(California) on 'Anlarson' was seized on the way. </p>

  <p>5. Mr. Kirpal Singh's admission into the inner committee of Mr. Sarat Chandra 
    Bose, directing the Gadar Party, was a mistake; as it was he who passed on 
    every piece of information of the Gadar party to the British government including 
    the date of rebellion. <br>

    </font></b><i>Nationalist pride-which sharpened into the militant potency 
    of Ghadar and its futile revolution.<br>
    Notes and references:</i><br>
    <br>
    1. The Ghadar movement was a loosely-knit organization of expatriate Punjabis 
    in North America, with headquarters in San Francisco, which printed revolutionary 
    literature against British rule in India, and attempted to send arms and guerilla 
    soldiers into India for an abortive revolutionary uprising planned for 1915. 
    The movement underwent a revival in the 1920's, with cadres of Punjabis active 
    in various Asian and European countries, in addition to San Francisco. There 
    are relatively few scholarly accounts of the Ghadar party written in the United 
    States, but a number of works are available in India, including these recent 
    studies: A.C. Bose: Indian Revolutionaries Abroad, Bharati Bhawan, Patna, 
    1971; G.S. Deol: The Role of the Ghadar party in the National Movement, Sterling 
    Publishers, Delhi, 1969; L.P. Mathur: Indian Revolutionary Movement in the 
    United States of America, S. Chand &amp; Co., Delhi, 1970; G.S. Sainsara,

    Ph.D. dissertation by Harish K. Puri, The Ghadar Party: A Study in Militant 
    Nationalism, Dept. of Political Science, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, 
    1975. An overview of the literature is given in Mark Juergensmeyer, &quot;The 
    International Heritage of the Ghadar Party: A Survey of the Sources,&quot; 
    in the American journal, Sikh Sansar, Vol. 2, No.1, March 1973, a revised 
    version of which appears in N.G. Barrier and Harbans Singh (eds.), Pujab Past 
    and Present: Essays in Honour of Dr. Ganda Singh, Panjabi University Press, 
    Patiala, 1976.<br>

    &quot;India's Berkeley Radial,&quot; in the Sunday edition of Times of India,

    5. The cry, ferenghi maro (&quot;destroy the foreigner&quot;) frequently appeared 
    in Ghadar literature.<br>
    6. See Sri Ram Sharma; Punjab in Ferment in the Beginning of the Twentieth 
    Century, Punjabi University, Department of Punjab Historical Studies, Patiala,

    7. The Alienation of Land Act allowed the traditional agricultural castes, 
    such as Jats, to retain rights to the land, while disallowing such rights 
    to urban Khatri, Arora and other merchant castes. Lower castes and Untouchables 
    were also excluded, since it was feared that they would be used as a front 
    for upper castes to purchase land. The adverse effect Act was to stabilize 
    caste mobility, and to strengthen the division of society along caste lines. 
    See N. G. Barrier: The Punjab Alienation of Land Bill 1900, Duke University 
    South Asia Series, Durham 1965.</p>
  <p>8. The economic and social effect of these disasters, and the continuing 
    problem of moneylenders, described in Sir Malcolm Darling: The Punjab Peasant 
    in Prosperity and Debt, Oxford University Press, London, 1925. A useful summary 
    of the conditions in the Punjab around the turn of the century may be found 
    in chapter 10, &quot;Rural Indebtedness and Peasant Agitation&quot; of Khushwant 
    Singh's History of the Sikhs, Vol II, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 
    1966.</p>
  <p>9. The official statistics of the Canadian government show that over 5,000 
    immigrants from India entered Canada between 1905 and 1908 (2,124 and 2,623, 
    respectively) (cited in R. K. Das, Hindustani Workers on the Pacific Coast, 
    Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, 1923). Official records in the United States indicate 
    a similar number of immigrants was probably quite a bit greater, allowing 
    for illegal entries. Once scholar has simply doubled the official figures 
    for her own working estimate (Joan M. Jensen, &quot;Federal Policy in the 
    Shaping of Indian Occupation in the United States, 1900-1917&quot;, paper 
    delivered at the Western Conference of the Association for Asian Studies, 
    Tempe, Arizona, 1974.</p>
  <p>10. Some of the immigrants who worked in the British Columbia lumber mills 
    had had previous acquaintance with the lumber industry in India, in their 
    home area of Hoshiarpur, a Punjab district with abundant forest lands.</p>
  <p>11. Estimates are as high as 75% of the immigrant males having served in 
    the army. Conditions of economic and social unrest in the Punjab which encourages 
    immigration also encouraged participation in the army; so it is not surprising 
    that a high number persons would seek both options of opportunity, in sequence.</p>
  <p>12. These indications of the immigrants' initial prosperity came from old 
    interviews, cited in Harish Puri, &quot;The Ghadar Party: A Study in Militant 
    Nationalism,&quot; Ph.D. dissertation in Political Science, Guru Nanak Dev 
    University, Amritsar, 1975, p. 39.</p>
  <p>13. These, and other incidents, are summarized in R. K. Dass: op. cit., and 
    A. C. Bose; Indian Revolutionaries Abroad, Bharati Bhawan, Patna, 1971.</p>
  <p>14. Harish Puri has raised an interesting argument regarding the motivation 
    for Canadian exclusion against the Punjabis. According to Puri (op. cit., 
    pp. 50-51), the Punjabis were excluded among other reasons, because their 
    residency in Canada would be used for anti-British purposes. Puri marshals 
    two pieces of evidence indicating this fear among the British: a statement 
    Colonel Swayne, seriously discussed by the British India office, which claimed 
    that &quot;dissatisfaction at unfair treatment of Indians in Vancouver is 
    certain to be exploited for the purpose of harshly than Japanese and Chinese. 
    Puri may be correct; but the fact of racial an economic prejudice against 
    the immigrant community made the exclusionary restrictions possible.</p>
  <p>15. A series of newspapers began to be published of newspapers began to be 
    published in British Columbia about this time, 1907-1909, with names such 
    as Free Hindustan, Aryan, and Swadesh Sewak; microfilmed copies of some of 
    the issues are on file at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. The 
    dominant themes of the newspaper are nationalist and anti-British, but some 
    articles reflect the local concerns of the immigrant community, especially 
    regarding immigration laws and economic problems.</p>
  <p>16. Tarak Nath Das came to the United states in 1906 as a student a the University 
    of California, Berkeley, but soon went to Canada to agitate for nationalist 
    causes among the immigrant community in British Columbia before returning 
    to the United States via Washington and Oregon, where he continued to be involved 
    in nationalist organization. Tarak Nath Das survived the difficulties that 
    the Ghadar party later encountered, and later in his life became a distinguished 
    professor of Indian Philosophy at Columbia University, New York.</p>
  <p>17. There is still a Gurudwa in Stockton, although most of the Punjabi immigrants 
    have shifted further north in the San Joaquin valley of California, where 
    they have recently erected a handsome new Gurudwara near the city of Marysville.</p>
  <p>18. One of the immigrant farmers, Jawala Singh, had become so wealthy through 
    the production of potatoes that he was called &quot;the potato king.&quot; 
    The San Joaquin valley of California is remarkably similar in climate and 
    demography to the irrigated areas of the Punjab; so the immigrant Pujabis 
    had a familiarity with farming techniques which gave them an advantage over 
    the American settlers of the newly irrigated areas of the San Joaquin valley. 
    The Pujabis' use of skillful techniques, their ability to work hard and save 
    their earnings, are described in Bruce LaBrack, &quot;Occupational Specialization 
    of California Sikhs: The Interplay of Culture and Economics,&quot; a paper 
    presented at the Fifth Punjab Studies Conference, Berkeley, California, March 
    21-23, 1975.</p>
  <p>19. The prohibition against owning land not only dampened the economic development 
    of many of their savings. Some of the money used to support the Ghadar party 
    come from the immigrant farmers who might otherwise have used it to purchase 
    land, or invent in equipment.</p>
  <p>20. It is these events that begin most accounts of the Ghadar &quot;Party&quot;, 
    which restrict their time span to the years of 1913 through 1917. In one regards 
    Ghadar as a movement, in a more general way, the history would begin in 1907, 
    when the first nationalist meetings occurred, and continue at least into the 
    1930's.</p>
  <p><br>
    21. Quite a few life histories of Ghadar members exist, many of them collected 
    for the composite history written by Gurcharan Singh Sainsara, op. cit., and 
    which are now on file in the Desh Bhagat Yaadgaar in Jullundur City, Punjab. 
    This is not, however, a representative sampling; but the life-histories do 
    indicate that the immigrants were motivated by the problems at home as well 
    as the opportunities abroad.</p>
  <p>22. There is no Act formally entitled &quot;Asiatic Exclusion Act.&quot; 
    The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1924 is often called the Oriental 
    (or Asiatic) Exclusion Act; but G.B. Lal is probably referring to the Alien 
    Land Law of 1913, which restricted Asian immigrants' rights to own land.</p>
  <p>23. Brown, Emily; Har Dayal: Hindu Revolutionary and Rationalist, University 
    of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1975, p. 141. Ghadar and other publications of the 
    Ghadar movement which are extant or have been translated by the U.S. government 
    and introduced as evidence during the trial of U.S.A. vs. Franz Bopp (now 
    in the U.S. archives in San Bruno, California), are almost exclusively concerned 
    with nationalist and anti-British issues. The link between the concerns of 
    the immigrant community and the nationalism of the Ghadar movement is to be 
    found in the life-histories of the participants (e.g. Sohan Singh Bhakna, 
    op. cit., Sainsara, op. cit., the unpublished autobiographical account of 
    the Ghadar movement by D. Chenchiah, on file in the Desh Bhagat, Yaadgaar, 
    Prithvi Singh Azad's Kranti Path Ka Pathik, and Nand Singh Sihra's article 
    in Modern Review, August 1913, &quot; Indians in Canada: A Pitiable Account 
    of Their Hardships by One Who Comes from the Place and<br>
    Knows Them&quot;)</p>
  <p>24. The ship, Kamagata Maru, was chartered by a group of Punjab immigrants 
    in an attempt to circumvent a devious Canadian regulation which denied entry 
    to any immigrant who did not arrive on a vessel sailing directly form the 
    immigrant's homeland; at the time, no such ship sailed from India. The Komagata 
    Maru was not allowed to land anyways; and this incident was directly responsible 
    for new converts to the Ghadar cause, and greatly encouraged the movement. 
    Two books have recently been published: Sohan Singh Josh: The Tragedy of Komagata 
    Maru, People's Publishing House, New Delhi, 1975; and Ted Ferguson: A White 
    Man's Country: And Exercise in Canadian Prejudice, Doubleday Canada Ltd., 
    Toronto, 1975. </p>
  <p>25. The attempted Ghadar uprising in 1915 benefited by World War I in two 
    ways: it hoped that the British army would be so distracted by the War that 
    they would not be able to control the anticipated uprising; and, more directly, 
    the Ghadarites received support from the British enemies, the German's in 
    the form of money, advice, and some arms.</p>
  <p>26. &quot;United States vs. Bhagat Singh Thind, Feb. 19. 1923&quot; in: Supreme 
    Court Reporter Vol. 43, No.10.</p>
  <p>27. Officially titled &quot;The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1924,&quot; 
    the so-called &quot;Asiatic Exclusion Act&quot; applied to Chinese and Japanese, 
    as well as South Asians, and not fully repealed until the U.S. Immigration 
    and Nationality Act of 1965.</p>
  <p>28. There was also an active attempt to link the Ghadar cause with America's 
    tradition of independence; pictures of Washington and Lincoln appeared in 
    the Ghadar papers, and in the 1920's new Ghadar newspaper was entitled &quot;The 
    United States of India.&quot;</p>
  <p>29. The relationship between the immigrant community and the White Americans 
    might explain the disintegration of the Ghadar movement, as well as the rise 
    of it. According to Professor Bruce LaBrack of the University of the Pacific, 
    California, who has studied the immigrant community, hostility towards the 
    immigrant community helps it to band together in a nationalist identity, as 
    we have described; but as that hostility wanes, and the community is more 
    accepted into society, then more parochial identities emerge, and the relationships 
    within the immigrant community are more fissiparous. And in fact, the tensions 
    between Jats and non-Jats, and between doaba Punjabis and those from Ludhiana, 
    Ferozepur and Amritsar.</p>

  <p>31. See Sohan Singh Bhakna's autobiography: Jeewan Sangram, Yuvak Kendar 
    Parkashan, Jullundur, 1967.</p>
  <p>32. At least one, Mangoo Ram, was from a Scheduled Caste (Chamar); he later 
    became a leader of the Ad Dharm movement on his return to Inida. Many of the 
    laborers in the fields in California were of higher castes, and would not 
    have engaged in such occupations in India.</p>
  <p>33. G.B. Lal, a colleague of Har Dayal, said that, &quot;most of the members 
    of the Party did not understand Har Dayal's finer teachings, only the nationalism&quot; 
    (interview with G.B. Lal, April, 1973).</p>
  <p>34. The relationship of former Ghadarites to the Punjab Communist Party is 
    described in Tilak Raj Chadha's &quot;Punjab's Red and White Communists: Scramble 
    for Funds from America,&quot; Thought, June 14, 1952. The international connections 
    are described by Gail Omvedt in &quot;Armed Struggle in India: The Ghadar 
    Party,&quot; Frontier, November 9, 1974 and November 16, 1974.</p>
  <p>35. It is not fair to describe the factional disputes within the Ghadar organization 
    as Hindu versus Sikh; nonetheless, the death of Ram Chandra removed the last 
    Hindu intellectual of significance from the movement's leadership.</p>
  <p>36. The Singh Sabha and the Gurudwara Reform Movement are evidences of this 
    identity consciousness.</p>
  <p>37. There were, no doubt, many kind and gracious White Americans who did 
    accept the new Punjabi immigrants with generosity. Unfortunately, there were 
    a significant number of others to create a climate of uneasiness about the 
    presence of the new immigrants. The popular press wrote about &quot;The turbaned 
    tide&quot; from India; and at the very extreme was hate-literature, such as 
    the tract, The White Man, which contained articles such as the &quot;The Hindu: 
    The Filth of Asia.&quot; Even in recent years, the immigrants Punjabis in 
    California are sometimes called ragheads.&quot;</p>
  <p>38. It was in South Africa, in 1893-1915, that Gandhi: Satyagraha in South 
    Africa, translated by V. G. Desai, Navajivan Trust, Ahmedabad, first published 
    in 1928.</p>
  <p>39. The motivation for the murder of Ram Chandra has never been settled, 
    but the event occurred in the context of the U.S. government trial against 
    Ghadar for its complicity with the Germans (U.S. vs. Franz Bopp, et al.), 
    which exacerbated the existing factional tensions within the movement. See 
    the interview with Mrs. Chandra on file in the Ghadar collection of the South 
    Asia Library Service, University of California, Berkeley, and also Bhagwan 
    Singh's Brief Sketch of Life Lived, issued by the Department of Public Relations, 
    Government of Punjab, 1948.</p>
  <p>40. Dilip Singh Saund won the elections, and became the first person of Asian 
    ancestry to sit in the U.S. House of Representatives. See D.S. Saund: congressman 
    from India, E.P. Dutton &amp; Co., New York, 1960.</p>
  <p>41. The most promising of new research on the immigrant community is that 
    of Professor Bruce LaBrack of Callison College, University of Pacific, Stockton. 
    LaBrack has compiled an extensive bibliography on the immigrant community. 
    &quot;The East Indian Experience in America,&quot; which is serialized in 
    the journal Sikh Sansar (Redwood City, California, 1976-77 issues). LaBrack's 
    own anthropological study of the community awaits publication. Prior to LaBrack, 
    the most comprehensive research on the community was undertaken by Professor 
    Harold Jacoby, also of the University of Pacific.</p>

    were roughly similar to those of other Asian communities; see Sucheng Chan, 
    &quot;Overseas Sikhs in the Context of Asian Migration,&quot; in Mark Jergensmeyer 
    and N.G. Barrier (eds.): Sikh Studies: Working Papers of the 1976 Summer Conference,

  <p><b><a name="Harnam"></a>Harnam Singh Tundilat<br>
    </b><b>Ghadriite Harnam Singh Tundilat (1882-1962)</b></p>
  <p><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghadriite Harnam Singh Tundilat (1882-1962), a Ghadr revolutionary 
    was born, 11 March 1882, the son of Gurdit Singh, a farmer of modest means, 
    of Kotla Naudh Singh, in Hoshiarpur district of the Punjab. He learnt to read 
    Gurmukhi in the village Dharamsala and joined the Indian army as he grew up. 
    On 12 July 1906, he emigrated to Canada and then to California in the United 
    States of America in December 1909.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There he worked in a lumber mill at Bridalville, 
    Oregon. He attended a meeting of Indian immigrants at Portland in the beginning 
    of 1912 which lead to the formation of Hindustani Workers of the Pacific Coast, 
    later renamed Hindi Association of the Pacific Coast, but popularly known 
    as the Ghadr Party. The first meeting of the association was held on March 
    3, 1913, he was made a member of the central executive. Meanwhile, it had 
    been decided to launch a weekly paper, Ghadr literally rebellion, to be published 
    in Urdu, Punjabi, Hindi and other Indian languages. The first issue of the 
    Ghadr in Urdu appeared on November 1, 1913, and its Punjabi edition followed 
    in January 1914. To begin with, Lala Hardayal was its editor, with Kartar 
    Singh Sarabha and Raghubir Dayal as assistant editors. Later, Harnam Singh, 
    with a few others, was also invited to join the editorial board. He wrote 
    verse in Punjabi and contributed to the poems burning with patriotic fervor. 
    He also acted as a bodyguard to Lala Hardayal, the party general secretary.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the expulsion of Lala Hardayal from America 
    in April 1914, party work at the Yugantar Ashram, its headquarters in San 
    Francisco, was redistributed. Harnam Singh was made editor of the Ghadr, with 
    four others, to assist him. Talk of an impending war between Great Britain 
    and Germany was in the air, and the programme of the Ghard Party was directed 
    towards a planned rebellion in India, as the British got involved in Europe. 
    While Udham Singh Kasel started imparting military training to party volunteers 
    and Kartar Singh Sarabha went to the eastern coast to brain as a filter-cum-aircraft 
    mechanic, Harnam Singh learnt bomb making from an American friend. During 
    an experiment on July 5, 1914, his left hand was blown and as a result of 
    which his arm had to be amputated well above the wrist. He was given by his 
    comrades the new name of Tundilat, The armless Lord. The epithet contained 
    an ironic allusion to Sir Henry Hardinge, governor-general of India (1844-48) 
    at the time of the first Anglo-Sikh war, who was called by the Punjabis Tundilat 
    because of his having lost a limb during the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the outbreak of World War 1 on 25 July 
    1914, the Ghadr Party directed its members and sympathizers to return to India 
    forthwith Harnam Singh came via Colombo and arrived in the Punjab on December 
    24, 1914. Disguised as a holy man in ochre robes, he roamed the Doaba villages 
    preaching the message of Ghadr. He also contacted, at the behest of the party, 
    troops in Rawalpindi, Bannu, Nowshera and Peshawar cantonments. The plan for 
    a military and general rising on February 21, 1915, later advanced to February 
    19, 1915, having tailed owning to betrayal by a police agent smuggled into 
    the party cadre, Harnam Singh Tundilat along with Kartar Singh Sarabha and 
    Jagat Singh of Sursingh escaped to the North-West Frontier Province to seek 
    temporary refuge in Afghanistan and plan afresh.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But receiving no support from that government, 
    they turned back and arrived on March 2, 1915, at Wilsonpur, a remount farm 
    in Chakk No. 105 in Shahpur (Sargodha) district, to stay with one Rajindar 
    Singh, a military pensioner and an acquaintance of Jagat Singh, himself an 
    ex-soldier. Rajindar Singh however, betrayed them to the police through Risaldar 
    Ganda Singh of Gandivand, who held charge of a remount farm. All three were 
    arrested and taken to Lahore Central Jail, where they were tried in what is 
    known as the First Lahore Conspiracy case. The trial by a special tribunal 
    under the Defencc of India Act 1914 began on 26 April 1915 and the judgment 
    was delivered on September 13, 1915. Harmam Singh Tundilat was one of the 
    twenty-four sentenced to death with forfeiture of property.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghadr leaders refused to file an appeal, 
    but the Viceroy on his own commuted the death penalty into life imprisonment 
    in the case of seventeen of them, inducing Harnam Singh. He served six years 
    in the Andamans and nine years in other jails in Madras, Pune, Bombay and 
    Montgomery. On September 15, 1930, he was released on medical grounds. He 
    served another term in jail from 1941to 1945. At the time of inter-communal 
    turbulence in 1947, he helped Muslim residents of his village and the surrounding 
    area to evacuate to refugee camps. He died on September 18, 1962 after a brief 
    illness.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harman Singh was a revolutionary poet and writer 
    of prose of considerable merit. Three collections of his poems have been published 
    Harnam Lafairan, Kurltl SudSIar and Harnam Sandesh. His prose works to include 
    Sacheha Sauda, Akhlaq te Mazhab, both in Punjabi, and Mazhab aur Insaniat, 
    in Urdu.</p>

												</span>It was in the very early 
												years of the twentieth century 
												that Swami Ram Tirath and Swami 
												Vivekananada had gone to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Swami Veivekananand was 
												invited to represent the Hindu 
												religion at the Conference of 
												Religions.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												Swami Ram Tirath had gone on his 
												own to preach the philosophy of

												1904-05, Swami Ram Tirath 
												published his articles about 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region> in the 
												Indian newspapers.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>There were very few 
												newspapers in those days and 
												most of them were weeklies.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The readers got some idea 
												of &amp; lt; st1:country-region&gt;<st1:place>America</st1:place> 
												by reading these comments.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The first Indians 
												migrated to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 
												1904-05.<span>&nbsp; </span>I 
												left my home on 11 May, 1906 
												enroute to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I took a ship from <st1:place>
												Hong Kong</st1:place> on 26<sup>th</sup> 
												June and reached 
<st1:City><st1:place>Vancouver</st1:place></st1:City> on <st1:date Month="7" 
Day="12" Year="1906">12<sup>th</sup> July, 1906</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												There were 52 Punjabi passengers

												This was the first ship carrying

												to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&amp;nbs 
												p; </span>Earlier, the ships 
												carried usually a complement of 
												10-12 Indians.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Later in 1907, many ships 
												carried as many as 700 Indians 
												and at least one ship carried 
												900 Indians to <st1:City><st1:place>
												Vancouver</st1:place></st1:City>.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>Most of the people going 
												to 
<st1:place>North America</st1:place> were unlettered.<span>&nbsp; </span>Less 
												than 5% of the whole lot knew 
												some Urdu or Gurmukhi.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Those knowing English 
												were few and far between.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>All these people went 
												there to do labour.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>During this period a few 
												Indians also reached there to 
												pursue studies.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Many of them, unable to 
												pay college and university fees, 
												joined the ranks of workers.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>An unskilled labourer 
												could earn a wage of two and a 
												half dollars a day in those 
												days.<span>&nbsp; </span>(The 
												dollar was equal to Rs. Three, 
												one anna and six pi es).<span>&nbsp;
												</span>All these manual workers 
												had absolutely no notion of 
												politics.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												However, a few of them did 
												resort to religious propaganda.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>Because of their 
												ignorance they did not have any 
												knowledge of the political 
												system of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>United States of America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>However all of them were 
												impressed with the democratic 
												state of governance in 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The slavery of the Indian 
												and the personal freedom of the 
												Americans appeared to them as 
												different as day and night.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Even the most 
												ill-informed and illiterate of 
												the Indians could see it for 
												themselves.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												Those who could read Urdu or 
												Gurmukhi would su bscribe to 
												papers in these languages from 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The English knowing read 
												the local papers.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Thus a study of the 
												newspapers and the experience of 
												day to day life in <st1:place>
												North America</st1:place> 
												gave birth to political 
												consciousness in the labourers.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>This is also my personal

												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>In 1909, the Canadian 
												government, under instructions 
												from the Government of India, 
												stopped the entry of Indians 
												into 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The Indians in 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> were 
												upset by this decision and a 
												sentiment of hurt developed in 
												them.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
												people struggled a lot but 
												nothing came of their efforts.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The government of the 
												United States did not take such 
												a step; therefore the Indians 
												made a bee-line for the United 
												States till 1914 when the 
												government of America also 
												banned the entry of Indian 
												labour in the United States and 
												refused them permission to 
												alight from ships.</p>

												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>Lala Har Dayal M. A. was 
												a Kayastha from <st1:City><st1:place>
												Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>He passed the I. C. S. 
												examination but due to physical 
												shortcomings and inability to 
												pass the horse-riding test, he 
												could not join the service.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>His visit to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region> brought 
												him face to face with the 
												slavery of the Indians and his 
												inability to get a job further 
												led to the development in him of 
												an anti-government sentiment.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>His fiery writings in the 
												Indian press made him a persona 
												non grata and he had to leave 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>His sojourn abroad led hi 
												m finally into 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 1911.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>While in 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>, he 
												continued contributing articles 
												to Indian newspapers. In this 
												way, the Urdu reading Indians in 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region> came to 
												know him well.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>Towards the end of 1907, 
												Sardar Ajit Singh, Sufi Amba 
												Parshad and Lala Thakur Dass of 
<st1:City><st1:place>Patiala</st1:place></st1:City> and some other patriots 
												escaped from 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and

												via 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Iran</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>(Sufi Amba Parshad was

<st1:country-region><st1:place>Iran</st1:place></st1:country-region> and 
												hanged).<span>&nbsp; </span>From 
												amongst them Lala Thakur Dass 
												and Rishi Kesh went to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>They came to stay with 
												Pandit Kanshi Ram of Ambala in 
												the town of <st1:City><st1:place>
												St. John</st1:City> in 
<st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Oregon</st1:PlaceName> 
<st1:PlaceType>State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 1911, 
												the American workers attacked 
												the Punjabi workers of St. John 
												Mill and looted their 
												belongings.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												The Punjabis were very few in 
												numbers.<span>&nbsp; </span>A 
												few more such incidents were 
												reported from other places in 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>At a few places Punjabi 
												labourers faced the American 
												workers squarely and tasted 
												victory also.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												These incidents left a deep 
												impact on all Indian workers.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>We were a group of ten to 
												fifteen Punjabis living at 
												Bridal Veil which was at a 
												distance of 30 miles from the 
												abode of Pandit Kanshi Ram.<span>&amp;nbs 
												p; ; </span>We used to meet 
												almost every week, but certainly 
												twice a month, in 
<st1:City><st1:place>Portland</st1:place></st1:City> on Sundays.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Two miles further away 
												from 
<st1:City><st1:place>St. John</st1:place></st1:City>, in the town on Linton in 
												Washington State Baba Sohan 
												Singh stayed with another group 
												of Punjabis.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												In those days Mr. Guru Datt 
												Kumar (Dev Samaji) lived in the 
												city of <st1:City><st1:place>
												Seattle</st1:place></st1:City> 
												in <st1:State><st1:place>
												Washington</st1:place></st1:State> 
												state.<span>&nbsp; </span>He 
												preached his faith amongst the 
												Americans.<span>&nbsp; </span>He 
												visited all the above towns and 
												in association with locals, he 
												formed an organization called 
												the Hindustani Association.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>In 1912, Baba Sohan Singh 
												Bhakna was elected president of 
												this association.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The main purpose of this 
												association was to preach 
												character-building in Indians 
												and ensure cooperation amongst 
												them.<span>&nbsp; </span>As a 
												Dev Samaji, Mr. Guru Datt Kumar 
												was also against drinking and 
												consuming animal flesh.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>This association could 
												not ender itself to Punjabi 
												labourers.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												The long indisposition of Guru 
												Dutt Kumar (who was the 
												secretary of this association) 
												due to a stomach ailment led to 
												the collapse of this 
												association.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												Exactly at this time Pandit 
												Thakur Dass proposed calling 
												Lala Har Dayal who was teaching 
												Sanskrit at the <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>
												University</st1:PlaceType> of 
<st1:PlaceName>California</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> at that time.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>1912 was coming to an 
												end.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was 
												assigned th e du ty of calling 
												Lala Har Dayal.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>After a good deal of 
												correspondence, he was able to 
												confirm to his colleagues that 
												Lala Har Dayal would reach <st1:City><st1:place>
												Portland</st1:place></st1:City> 
												on Christmas Day (<st1:date Month="12" Day="25" Year="1912">25<sup>th</sup> 
												December, 1912</st1:date>).<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Due to heavy snowfall the 
												lumber mills were usually closed 
												for twenty to thirty days 
												leaving the labourers free to do 
												anything.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
												news of the impending arrival of 
												Har Dayal spread a wave of 
												excitement amongst the people 
												who were familiar with his name.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>But he could not reach on 
												the specified date.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>All of us were 
												disappointed but Lala Thakur 
												Dass informed that he had 
												promised to come later.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The snow melted and the 
												factor ies restarted and 
												everybody got busy in his work.</p>

												Kanshi Ram from 
<st1:City><st1:place>St. John</st1:place></st1:City>.<span>&nbsp; </span>He told

												Parmanand had reached <st1:City><st1:place>
												St. John</st1:place></st1:City> 
												and asked me to take the six o

												9.00 P. M. and was ushered into 
												the presence of Lala Har Dayal 
												and Bhai Parmanand.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>At night we held 
												discussions with the two newly 
												arrived compatriots.<span styl="" e="m

												bring out <b>Ghadar</b> 
												newspapers in 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region> and 
												start anti-British propaganda 
												amongst the Indians in 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The preparations for the 
												Ghadar in 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> should 
												start from 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>On the other hand Bhai 
												Parmanand expressed his opinion 
												that students from 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> should be 
												called to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region> and 
												helped to educate themselves.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>None of the comrades 
												present there agreed to the 
												suggestion of Bhai P a rmanand.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>All of us were unanimous 
												in our acceptance of the 
												proposal of Lala Har Dayal.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The next morning Bhai 
												Parmanand left by train for <st1:State><st1:place>
												New York</st1:place></st1:State> 
												en-route to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Lala Har Dayal agreed to 
												meet friends in Bridal Veil 
												along with comrades from <st1:City><st1:place>
												St. John</st1:place></st1:City> 
												and 
<st1:City><st1:place>Portland</st1:place></st1:City>.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was 
												decided that we would visit 
												every factory on one or the 
												other Sunday and talk to Indians 
												there explaining the proposal.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>It was also decided to 
												make an appeal for help to raise
												<b>Ghadar</b>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The first meeting was 
												help in Bridal Veil where around 
												1500 In di ans worked.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>After a brief speech by 
												Lala Har Dayal all the workers 
												present there enrolled as 
												members and offered different 
												amounts as subscription.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>In this way the first 
												branch of the party was formed 
												in Bridal Veil.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Lala Har Dayal proposed 
												that for every Branch a 
												secretary and a treasurer should 
												be elected to perform different 
												functions.<span>&nbsp; </span>I 
												was elected secretary and Bhai 
												Amar Singh Kotla Naudh Singh was 
												elected treasurer.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>He also proposed that 
												volunteers may be recruited for 
												work in the headquarters of the 
												party.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
												volunteers would work without 
												any remuneration and would be 
												stationed at the headquarters at 
<st1:City><st1:place>San Francisco</st1:place></st1:City> from where the paper 
												would be brought out.<span styl="" e="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
												</span>The party headquarter 
												would be called the Ghadar 
												Ashram.<span>&nbsp; </span>He 
												was hopefulof the help of some 
												American friends there who would 
												support us in our fight against 
												the British government.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>He also informed that the 
												volunteers who would work at the 
												newspaper office will not be 
												able to go back to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> because 
												their name would be on the black 
												list of the C. I. D. of India.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Balwant Singh of Sanghwal 
												village in Jalandhar district 
												offered his name as a volunteer.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Lala Har Dayal informed 
												us that the volunteers would be 
												called up as when needed.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>This brought to a close 
												the formation of the first 
												branch of the party in the state 
												of <st1:State><st1:place>Oregon</st1:place>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>It was decided to hold 
												the next meeting at Linton at 
												the residence of Baba Sohan 
												Singh which could be attended by 
												friends from <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>
												Portland</st1:PlaceName> 
<st1:PlaceType>City</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> and Linton.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>As agreed the meeting was 
												help at Linton in the first week 
												of April, 1913.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>There again Lala Har 
												Dayal made a brief speech and 
												called for the formation of the 
												party.<span>&nbsp; </span>He 
												appealed to all Indians to join 
												in the effort.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>His appeal found instant 
												acceptance.<span>&nbsp; </span>A 
												party branch was formed here.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Pandit Kanshi Ram was 
												elected secretary and Lala 
												Thakur Dass as treasurer.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>In a similar fashion on 
												the next Sunday in the second 
												week of April the party branch 
												was formed at Wina and in the 
												third week at <st1:City><st1:place>
												Astoria</st1:place></st1:City>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Almost all Indians at 
												these places joined the party 
												and contributed to the funds.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>They also agreed to make 
												regular contributions.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>From these three of four 
												centers we got so many members 
												and volunteers and financial 
												help that it became possible to 
												bring out both the Urdu and 
												Gurmukhi editions.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>In 
<st1:City><st1:place>Astoria</st1:place></st1:City>, the representatives of the 
												three branches were present.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Lala Har Dayal was happy 
												at this successful turnout and 
												proposed that party office 
												bearers be elected.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Baba Sohan Singh was 
												elected President unanimously 
												and Bhai Kesar Singh Thathgarh, 
												Vice President.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Lala Har Dayal was 
												elected General Secretary and 
												Pandit Kanshi Ram of Maruli, 
												district Ambala was elected 
												treasurer.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												The young Udham Singh (who later 
												achieved martyrdom) of Kasel, 
												district 
<st1:City><st1:place>Amritsar</st1:place></st1:City> was elected secretary of 
												Wina branch and Karim Baksh of 
												Hoshiarpur of Astoria branch.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>The following aims and 
												objects of the party were also 
												established.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												1) To bring out a paper in 
												Hindustani languages for the 
												propaganda of the American 
												party.<span>&nbsp; </span>2) To 
												establish branches in other 
												countries.<span>&nbsp; </span>3) 
												To train comrades in America and 
												to send them to India in a 
												clandestine fashion to organize 
												secret branches of the party in 
												India and<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>4) To organize patriotic 
												propaganda in the armed forces 
												and to win them over to the 
												party progamme of a Ghadar like 
												insurrection.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>During his tour of 
<st1:State><st1:place>Oregon</st1:place></st1:State>, Lala Har Dayal mentioned 
												about other comrades working in 
												the fields and orchards of 
<st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State> who were prepared to 
												help this mission 
												wholeheartedly.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The following names are 
												worth mentioning: Bhair Rur 
												Singh and Bhai Chanan Singh of 
												Chuharchak, Pandit Jagat Ram of 
												Haryana, district Hoshiarpur, 
												Kartar Singh Sarabha and Kartar 
												Singh Dukki of Latala, 
												district Ludhiana.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>After necessary 
												consultations, Lala Har Dayal 
												returned to <st1:State><st1:place>
												California</st1:place></st1:State> 
												promising to bring out the paper 
												from <st1:City><st1:place>San 
												Francisco</st1:place></st1:City>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>We all started waiting 
												for the publication of the 
												paper.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
												months of June, July, August, 
												etc. went by but the paper did 
												not come out.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												Many friends, on the basis of 
												their earlier experience, were 
												convinced that, like other 
												scholarly patriots, Lala Har 
												Dayal knew only how to collect 
												subscriptions and lacked the 
												will for practical activity.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Letters were addressed to 
												Lalaji.<span>&nbsp; </span>He 
												replied that due to his illn 
												ess, he could not attend to the 
												publication of the paper.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>He advised us to call up 
												Sardar Ajit Singh for this work.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The comrades from <st1:State><st1:place>
												Oregon</st1:place></st1:State> 
												and <st1:State><st1:place>
												Washington</st1:place></st1:State> 
												states put their heads together 
												and decided that the treatment 
												of Lalaji may be financed by the 
												party and he was offered 25 
												dollars per month for his 
												expenses.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												This plan was put into operation 
												and Lalaji was duly informed.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>A young man by the name 
												of Raghbar Dayal Gupta 
												(belonging to an affluent family 
												of U. P.) was sent from Bridal 
												Veil to <st1:City><st1:place>San 
												Francisco</st1:place></st1:City> 
												to look after him.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Lala Har Dayal, with the 
												cooperation of Kartar Singh 
												Sarabha took out the fist issue 
												of the Ghadar in S e ptember and 
												it was received by post.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>A litho press had been 
												arranged in the meantime.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>After a few weeks, the 
												Gurmukhi edition of the paper 
												was also brought out.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The demand for the 
												newspaper far exceeded the 
												supply.<span>&nbsp; </span>When 
												we demanded additional copies, 
												Lalaji informed that the Hand 
												machine could not print more.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>He proposed the purchased 
												of a second hand electric 
												machine which was available for 
												2200 dollars.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												The money was arranged from 
<st1:State><st1:place>Oregon</st1:place></st1:State> and 
<st1:State><st1:place>Washington</st1:place></st1:State> state branches.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>But the machine was 
												purchased for 1100 dollars.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The Ghadar newspape r was 
												not a priced publication but 
												patriotism was mentioned as 
												the price desired from everyone.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The newspaper was 
												published weekly in Urdu and 
												Gurmukhi and circulated in 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>, American 
												and many other countries.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>In the first few weeks 
												its copies also reached 
												addresses in 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Later when the CID became 
												alert, issues of the newspaper 
												were sent in sealed envelopes 
												and by other secret methods.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The publication of the 
												Ghadar caused sleepless nights 
												to the British government, the 
												imperial government in 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and other 
												places where British imperialism 
												reigned.<span>&nbsp; </span>They 
												made elabo ra te plans to 
												restrict the circulation of the 
												paper.<span>&nbsp; </span>All 
												entry points in 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> were 
												directed to scrutinize all mail 
												coming from 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region> and 
												preparations were set afoot to 
												stop the publication of the 
												paper from 
<st1:City><st1:place>San Francisco</st1:place></st1:City>.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>Lala Thakur Dass of 
<st1:City><st1:place>St. John</st1:place></st1:City> pointed out to an ominous 
												danger to the members and the 
												President.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												There was every likelihood that 
												Lala Har Dayal could be abducted 
												or even murdered.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The active members 
												therefore decided that a worker 
												may be detailed permanently to 
												look after the security of Lala 
												Har Dayal.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												All of them proposed my name for 
												this job.<span>&nbsp; </span>I 
												received a letter written by 
												Sohan Singh Bhakna in his own 
												hand directing me to go to 
<st1:City><st1:place>San Francisco</st1:place></st1:City> and to ensure the 
												security of Lala Har Dayal.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I was warned to be 
												extremely alert.&amp; lt; SPAN 
												style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&nbsp; 
												Since I was the first one to 
												volunteer, I was chosen for this 
												assignment.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												On the receipt of the command of 
												the president, I left my job and 
												reached <st1:City><st1:place>San 
												Francisco</st1:place></st1:City> 
												on first of November to take up 
												my new assignment.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>When I knocked at the 
												gate of the house at 36, <st1:Street><st1:address>
												Hill Street</st1:address></st1:Street> 
												at seven in the morning, Lala 
												Har Dayal, Raghbar Dayal Gupta 
												and Kartar Singh Sarabha were 
												still asleep.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												I knocked for quite sometime and 
												then the gate was opened by a 
												handsome youngman of about 18 
												who had not sprouted a beard or 
												a moustache so far.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I asked him: Are you 
												Kartar Singh?<span>&nbsp; </span>
												He replied yes and we both 
												embraced each other.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I went inside and said 
												Bande Matram to Lala Har Dayal 
												and Raghbar Dayal while they 
												were still in their beds.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>The press machine was 
												installed at No. 5, <st1:Street><st1:address>
												Wood Street</st1:address></st1:Street>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>A white American had been 
												employed at half a dollar an 
												hour to operate the machine and 
												teach Kartar Singh to handle it.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Kartar Singh had learnt 
												to operate the Litho press and 
												the electric machine.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The calligraphy of the 
												Urdu paper was done by Lala 
												Raghbar Dayal.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The Gurmukhi translation 
												was done by Kartar Singh.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I had very little to do 
												because my services were needed 
												only when Lala Har Dayal moved 
												out.<span>&nbsp; </span>I also 
												started working in the press to 
												fill up the need of ma npower.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Since I had earlier 
												worked on a number of machines, 
												I was quick to learn the 
												operation of the press machine.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>We were faced with the 
												problem of relieving the white 
												American from the job since we 
												thought he was being paid very 
												highly for the job performed by 
												him.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our own 
												people were ready to work on 
												this machine at a wage of 25 to 
												30 cents per hour.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I wrote to the President 
												and sent Amar Singh Chauhan of 
<st1:City><st1:place>St. John</st1:place></st1:City> to take it up.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>On his arrival we 
												relieved the white American and 
												thus the entire work of the 
												press was undertaken by 
												patriotic Indian volunteers.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>It is unfortunate that 
												this youngman, Amar Singh 
												Chauhan, upon the failure of the 
												Ghadar uprising, became an app r 
												over and a prosecution witness 
												and in order to save his own 
												skin, gave evidence which led to 
												the hanging of many comrades.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>He belonged to Nawanshahr 
												Doaba town.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>On <st1:date Month="11" Day="20" 
Year="1912">November 20<sup>th</sup>, 1912</st1:date>, a young Indian patriot 
												threw a bomb at Lord Hardinge, 
												the then Viceroy of India.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>To commemorate this 
												occasion, Lala Har Dayal 
												pre-dated the issue dated 22<sup>nd</sup> 
												November to 20<sup>th</sup> 
												November and wrote an article 
												entitled Philosophy of the 
												Bomb.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
												next issue carried the date of 
												27<sup>th</sup> November and all 
												future issues were published at 
												a weeks interval in relation to 
												the issue of 20<sup>th</sup> 
												November.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>It is important to relate 
												here that in spite of the 
												democratic structure of the 
												party, Lala Har Dayal was 
												exclusively responsible for the 
												policy of the Ghadar newspaper.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>In November and December, 
												1913, Basant Singh from <st1:City><st1:place>
												Ludhiana</st1:place></st1:City> 
												and Kartar Singh Dukki of 
												Latala came to work in the 
												electric press.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Lala Har Dayal proposed 
												that all the volunteers employed 
												in the electric press should 
												bear their own expenses and when 
												they had used all their savings, 
												they may take up jobs again and 
												other volunteers may take their 
												place.<span>&nbsp; </span>Having 
												worked for a month and a half in 
												the press, I found this proposal 
												to be very faulty.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Then in consultation with 
												Har Dayal, I wrote a letter to 
												Bhai Sohan Singh requesting him 
												to have all the expenses on food 
												etc. incurred by the volunteers 
												defrayed from party treasury.<span>&nbsp; 
												; ; </span>I also proposed 
												payment of a token sum of two 
												dollars per month for pocket 
												expenses.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												Since my proposal was backed 
												with full details, the president 
												took no time in taking a 
												decision and this became 
												effective from January, 1914.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>Lala Har Dayal would 
												sometimes publish political 
												poems which he managed to 
												receive from here and there.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Kartar Singh Sarabha 
												translated Urdu verse into 
												Gurmukhi.<span>&nbsp; </span>He 
												tried his hand at writing poetry 
												in Punjabi for the Gurmukhi 
												edition but he found that he did 
												not have the gift for poetry.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Among the Urdu poems 
												published I remember one which 
												was published earlier in the 
												weekly <b>Aftab</b> of <st1:City><st1:place>
												Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>It commemorated the 
												return of Bal Gangadhar Tilak 
												after his six years in exile.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The editor of <b>Aftab</b>, 
												Syed Haider Raza was sentenced 
												to three years imprisonment for 
												writ ing an inflammatory article 
												in his paper.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												I also remember another poem 
												which was written by a <st1:City><st1:place>
												Delhi</st1:place></st1:City> 
												poet Lala Ganeshi Dass Khasta.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>The Urdu newspapers and 
												magazines of that time carried a 
												number of political poems but 
												the Gurmukhi papers did not 
												publish any poems in Punjabi.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>There was till that time 
												no tradition of writing 
												political poetry in Punjabi.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>After Kartar Singhs poor 
												effort, I thought of trying my 
												hand at Punjabi poetry.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Luckily I succeeded in 
												writing good political poetry.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Let me explain why I 
												succeeded.</p>

												</span><b>Life in the Army and 
												the Urge to Write Poetry<o:p></o:p></b></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>I had studied up to fifth 
												class in the village school and 
												my education came to an end when 
												I was hardly thirteen years of 
												age.<span>&nbsp; </span>There 
												was a Nirmala Sant in our 
												village.<span>&nbsp; </span>He 
												liked to recite Heer of Waris 
												Shah and Quissas of Puran 
												Bhagat, Shah Behram etc.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>In his company many young 
												men from the village got 
												interested in reading these 
												quissas.<span>&nbsp; </span>I 
												was also interested in singing 
												since my childhood.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I started learning 
												Gurmukhi in pursuance of my 
												interest.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 
												the company of the Sant I became 
												an avid teacher.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Due to financial 
												difficult ies of my family, I 
												followed other friends of the 
												village and joined the army in 
												1902 when I was only eighteen.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I continued reading these 
												ballads in the army also.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I also improved my 
												knowledge of Urdu and Gurmukhi.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I started writing poetry 
												in Punjabi and without any help 
												from any source, I undertook 
												writing the story of Shah Bahram 
												in Punjabi verse.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I made some 
												improvisations in the tale and 
												prepared a book of some 250 to 
												300 pages.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>In 1904, in Noshehra 
												cantonment, a Sikh sepoy of 
												Jalandhar district shot dead his 
												Sikh subedar who hailed from 
												Hoshiarpur district.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>He was led to this act 
												because of some injustice 
												suffered by him at the hands of 
												the subedar.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												Since I was always a votary of 
												justice and truth, I viewed his 
												act as a brave example inspired 
												by a sense of justice.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>While the army man was 
												undergoing Court Martial 
												proceedings, I developed 
												friendly relations with him and 
												told him that if he was hanged 
												for his act, I would write his 
												tale of bravery in Punjabi verse 
												and get it published.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The sepoy was sentenced 
												to death and hanged in Noshehra 
												Cantt.<span>&amp; ;nbs p; </span>In 
												order to keep my promise, I 
												wrote the entire story in verse 
												employing Korda Chhand, Sawayya 
												and Kabit.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												However I could not collect 
												funds for its publication.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>A whole year (1905) 
												passed without any success.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I was given the duty of 
												distributing mail in the platoon 
												and for a few months I was also 
												employed for teaching Punjabi 
												and Urdu to other soldiers.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>While distributing mail, 
												I came across two Urdu weeklies
												<b>Army News</b> of <st1:City><st1:place>
												Ludhiana</st1:place></st1:City> 
												and <b>Akhbar-e-Aam</b> of <st1:City><st1:place>
												Lahore</st1:place></st1:City> 
												which were subscribed to by a 
												Jamadar and a clerk. The <b>
												Akhbar-e-Aam</b> contained 
												articles by Swami Ram Tirath 
												about his experiences in 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the 
												life of people there.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I came to learn that in <st1:country-region><st1:place>
												America</st1:country-region> 
												an ordinary worker earned six to 
												seven rupees a day.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>But I still did not know 
												how I could reach American and 
												how I could collect the money 
												for the journey.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>A soldier from out 
												company had left the army a year 
												earlier.<span>&nbsp; </span>He 
												had gone to 
<st1:City><st1:place>Kuala Lumpur</st1:place></st1:City> 
												(<st1:place>Malaya</st1:place>) 
												and joined the police.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>He wrote to a friend in 
												the company that he was employed 
												at Rs. 15 per month and advised 
												him to resign his job and join 
												him.<span>&nbsp; </span>A 
												soldier was paid Rs. 9 per month 
												in the army.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												He also informed that there was 
												a country further away called 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the 
												way to that land was open.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The wages are fabulous 
												but the fare is rupees three 
												hundred.<span>&nbsp; </span>A 
												friend of mine was cashiered 
												from the army at about this 
												time.<span>&nbsp; </span>He also 
												declared that he would leave for 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and would 
												write to me from there.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>A little earlier, Amar 
												Singh, another person from my 
												village, had also left for 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and 
												was employed as a watchman at 
												the shop of a Chinese merchant.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>He also spoke of going to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I also started dreaming 
												about 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region> but I 
												did not have the fare and knew 
												no way to arrange it.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span>As already related, my 
												friend had left the army and 
												joined the police force of the 
												Hunan Syndicate Railway.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>In a letter he wrote of 
												his desire to go to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region> and in 
												the second one he called me 
												over.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was 
												10<sup>th</sup> of February, 
												1906 and a general parade was 
												organized in Rawalpindi Cantt.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>All soldiers were ordered 
												to join the parade.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>Orderlies and post office 
												workers, who were not required 
												to join normal parades, were 
												also required to attend this 
												parade.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had 
												not participated in any parade 
												for one and a half year.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I stood at my position in 
												the first section of the first 
												company in second or third 
												column.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
												inspecting Captain found fault 
												with my posture and hauled me up 
												in the office to explain my 
												position.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												This order brought a complete 
												change in me.<span>&nbsp; </span>
												I took the excuse that I was 
												suffering from the ravage of 
												heat and fell down.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>The earth was wet on 
												account of rainfall.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>My clothes and the rifle 
												were both soiled.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I was escorted on the 
												orders of an Indian officer to 
												the hospital for medication.<span>&nbsp;
												</span>I decided to leave my job 
												in the army and I told the 
												Havildar that the barrel of the 
												gun had been soiled and he could 
												clean it up.<span>&nbsp; I shall 
												not carry this gun from now 
												onwards.&nbsp; The havildar was 
												bewildered by my reply.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												When the soldiers returned to 
												the barracks after the parade, I 
												told my subedar that I did not 
												wish to continue and requested 
												him to take me to the office for 
												getting my name struck of the 
												rolls.&nbsp; He refused to 
												accompany me.&nbsp; I told him 
												that I knew the way to office 
												and if he did not take me along, 
												I shall go by myself.&nbsp; The 
												subedar major who belonged to a 
												Dogra family of Hoshiarpur, when 
												apprised of my intentions, tried 
												to hold me back and greed to 
												raise my rank from Sepoy to 
												Lance Naik immediately.&nbsp; I 
												had earlier passed the test and 
												was ranked number one.&nbsp; But 
												I informed the subedar major 
												that I would not stay in th e 
												army even if I was offered the 
												rank of subedar major.&nbsp; As 
												the rules stood then, any 
												armyman could not leave the unit 
												of his own accord before serving 
												for at least three years.&nbsp; 
												I had already served for three 
												years and two months.&nbsp; 
												Therefore, much against his 
												will, the commanding officer had 
												to discharge me from the army.&nbsp; 
												The same day, after settlement 
												of my accounts, I took a <st1:time Hour="0" 
Minute="0">midnight</st1:time> train for my village.&nbsp; I waited for the 
												letter from my friend which 
												arrived some two months after I 
												left the army.&nbsp; He informed 
												me that the passport for travel 
												to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> and 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region> could be 
												obtained in <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> 
												and regular shipping lines were 
												available which gladly took 
												Indians as passengers.&nbsp; The 
												total fare from 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> would be 
												around rupees three hundred.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												After the receipt of this letter 
												I prevailed upon two of my 
												friends also to accompany me on 
												the journey and for my fare I 
												arranged three hundred and fifty 
												rupees from a moneylender on the 
												security of my brother.&nbsp; It 
												was also ensured that none apart 
												from my elder brother knew about 
												the details of the journey so 
												that neither the family nor the 
												village folk could create any 
												obstructions as it was 
												considered that traveling so far 
												was tantamount to destruction of 
												home and hearth.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												All the three of us left our 
												village on <st1:date Month="5" Day="11" Year="1906">
												11 May 1906</st1:date> 
												stealthily at night.&nbsp; We 
												took the rail to 
<st1:City><st1:place>Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City> and took a British ship to 
<st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place>. The third class fare was rupees thirty-five 
												which included third class 
												food also.&nbsp; But most Indian 
												travelers, afraid of being 
												served food prohibited by 
												religion, took their rations 
												along.&nbsp; But we did not do 
												so.&nbsp; We had no taboos and 
												my views had undergone change in 
												the last few years.&nbsp; I had 
												been liberated of much of 
												superstition and religious cant.&nbsp; 
												Before joining the army, I had 
												already read books like Panth 
												Prakash, Suraj Prkash and the 
												lifestory of the sixth Guru 
												Hargobind.</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												At <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> 
												we had to stay for a few days 
												waiting for a suitable passage.&nbsp; 
												The ship that I took from <st1:place>
												Hong Kong</st1:place> had 52 
												Punjabi passengers.&nbsp; Before 
												this such a large number of 
												Indians had never traveled in a 
												single ship.&nbsp; Barring four 
												or five persons, most of the 
												travelers were from the 
												districts of Jalandhar and 
												Hoshiarpur.&nbsp; So far almost 
												a hundred Indians had reached 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> and 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; 
												Those who reached North American 
												countries wrote to their friends 
												and relatives and the flow of 
												Punjabis to Canada increased and 
												between 1905 and 1908 around ten 
												thousand Indians had reached 
												America and Canada and most of 
												them were Punjabis from the 
												districts of Amritsar, Jalandhar, 
												Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana and 
												Ferozepur.&nbsp; More than 98 
												percent of them came from 
												peasantry.</p>

<p><i>Originally published in GADAR, a Newsletter of the Gadar Memorial Center,
5 Wood Street, San Francisco, CA 94117 November/December 1992 </i></p>

<p><i>(This is part I of an article translated from a Punjabi originally
written by Sardar Bhagat Singh. Kartar Singh Sarabha began his involvement in
the Gadar Party in San Francisco in 1912. Part II will be published in the next
issue)</i>[I got from Ved Prakash Vatuk from Gadar Heritage Foundation,
Berkeley. Part 2 was never published.--T.S.Sibia] </p>

<p>Revolutionary Kartar Singh, the great devotee of Bellona, the goddess of
war, was not even twenty years old when he sacrificed himself on the altar of
goddess of freedom. He appeared like a storm from somewhere, ignited the flame
of revolution and tried to wake up the sleeping Bellona. He blazed the holy
yajna of revolution and became himself an offering for the same. Who was he?
From what world did he suddenly appear? And where did he go? We were awestruck.
Such courage, self-confidence, and dedication is rarely found. Few persons have
been born in India who can be called revolutionary in true sense of the word.
Kartar Singh's name comes at the top among these few. Revolution lived in his
veins. There was only one aim of his life, only one desire, only one hope - all
that held meaning in his life was revolution. </p>

<p>Kartar Singh was born in Sarabha, a village in district Ludhiana, in 1896.
He was the only son of his parents. He was still very young when his father
died. His grandfather brought him up with great care. After passing the ninth
grade, he went to Orissa to live with his uncle. He completed his high school
and began college while there. It was the year 1910-1911, when he had the
opportunity to read a lot of books outside the narrow range of school or
college text books. This was also the time of nationalist movement. It was this
political environment that aroused the feeling of patriotism in him. It was
then that he decided that he must travel to America. </p>

<p>The family did not have any opposition to that. He arrived in San Francisco
in 1912. Having arrived in the &quot;free nation&quot; his tender heart was
subjected to blows and humiliation at every step. He would be very upset when
he heard himself being called a damn Hindu or black man by the whites. At every
step he felt his country's dignity and respect in jeopardy. With the constant
memory of home, he also visualized India - helpless and in chains. His tender
heart began to harden gradually and his determination to sacrifice his life for
the freedom of country began to become firm. </p>

<p>It was impossible for him to remain calm. The question began to haunt him.
How would the country become free if peaceful means failed. Without wasting
much time in thinking, he began to organize Indian laborers. Passion for
freedom began to grow in them. He would sit with a worker for hours and explain
to him how death is thousand times preferable to life of slavery filled with
humiliation. Many persons joined him when the work progressed. A special
meeting of these people took place in May 1912. A few selected Indians attended
that meeting. All of them took vow to dedicate their mind, body and wealth for
the freedom of their country. Meantime the exiled Punjabi patriot Bhagwan Singh
reached there. Meetings began to take place in a great number. </p>

<p><a name=part2></a><strong>Part 2 </strong></p>

<p>Intensive teaching became the name. Work was increased. The file was
prepared. Then the need for a paper was felt. A paper named Gadar was launched.
Its first issue was published in November 1913. Kartar Singh was also a member
of its editorial board. His pen was very powerful. Members of the editorial
board printed the paper on a hand press. Kartar Singh was a carefree young man
who loved revolution. Whenever he was tired running the press, he would <a
href="gadarpoems.html#poemedit2">sing:</a></p>

<p><i>Serving ones country is very difficult<br>
It is so easy to talk<br>
Anyone who walked on that path<br>
Must endure millions of calamities.</i></p>

<p>The dedication with which Kartar Singh worked gave courage to all others.
Whether anyone else knew how to make India free or not, whether anyone else
ever thought about it or not, Kartar Singh had given a lot of thought. In the
meantime he joined an institute in New York to learn how to fly a plane and
began his mission there wholeheartedly. </p>

<p>In September 1914 Kamagata Maru ship had to return without unloading its
human cargo after its passenger suffered indescribable tortures at the hand of
the imperialist whites. So Kartar Singh along with Kranti Priya Gupta and an
American anarchist named Jack went to Japan. He met Baba Gurdit Singh in Kobe
and held consultations with him. </p>

  <p>From Yugantar Ashram, San Francisco, copies of <i>Gadar</i>, <a
href="gadardigunj.html"><i>Ghadar di gunji</i></a> and many other publications 
    were printed and distributed regularly. Propaganda was increasing every day. 
    Enthusiasm kept in the air. In a public meeting held in Stockton in February 
    1914, Indian freedom flag was unfurled. Oaths for freedom and equality were 
    taken. Kartar Singh was one of the main speakers in this meeting. All the 
    people present there declared that they would all their had earned money to 
    the struggle for countrys freedom. Suddenly the news from Europe came that 
    the World War I had started. They were overjoyed. In a one voice they sang 
    &quot;Let's return to wage a war for the country&quot;, which became the last 
    words and orders. </p>

<p>Kartar Singh forcefully advocated for returning to India. Then he himself
sailed for Colombo (Sri Lanka). In those people returning from America and
going to Punjab were quite often safely. But Kartar Singh did. He dedicated
himself to the Party wholeheartedly. They lacked organization. Somehow that was
created. In December young Maratha revolutionary Vishnu Ganesh Pingle also
reached India. Through their efforts Shachindra Nath Sanyal and Ras Behari also
came to Punjab. Kartar Singh was everywhere - if there was a secret meeting in
Moga, he was there, next day, message was to be spread among the students in
Lahore, he would be the first to be there. Next, the efforts were being made to
have an alliance with Ferozepur Cantonments soldiers or there was a need to go
to Calcutta for acquiring the arms. He would go everywhere. But there was no
money. For that Kartar Singh suggested armed robbery. Many of his colleagues
were dumb-founded at the suggestion. He asked them not to worry, told them that
even Bhai Parmanand is in favor of robberies. He was given the job to confirm
this assertion. Next day he told his colleagues that he had asked him and had
his consent. He could not bear the thought that due to the lack of finances,
there should be a delay in launching a revolution. </p>

<p>One day, they went to a village for the purpose of carrying out a robbery.
Kartar Singh was their leader. While robbery was in progress, there was a
beautiful young woman in the house. Seeing her a heinous thought came in the
mind of a sinner. He forcefully grabbed the woman by the hand. The woman
shrieked out of fear. Kartar Singh immediately took out his pistol, reach that
person, and place the pistol on his forehead, disarmed him and shouted,
&quot;You wretched man, your crime is very serious, you should be punished to
die for that. But the circumstances force us to forgive you. But you fall on
the feet of this woman, ask her forgiveness by saying, my sister, forgive me
please. Then forgiveness for this fall of mine, If they forgive you, we will
let you remain alive, otherwise you shall be shot dead.&quot; He obliged. The
matter had not gone too far. </p>

<p>Seeing this, eyes of the mother and her daughter were filled with tears. In
an affectionate tone the mother said to Kartar Singh, &quot;Son, you seem in
such a heinous work? Kartar Singh was deeply moved. He said, &quot;Mother, we
are not doing this because of greed for money. In money for arms. How else can
we get that? Mother, we have been forced to do this for the great goal (of
Indias freedom).&quot; It was a very painfully moving scene. The mother spoke
again, &quot;We have to marry this girl away. It would be nice if you could
leave some for that.&quot; Kartar Singh placed all the money before the mother
and said, &quot;Take whatever you want.&quot; The mother took some money, placed
the rest in the bag of Kartar Singh and gave him blessings, &quot;Go, my son,
may you succeed in your mission.&quot; This episode shows that even when Kartar
Singh was involved in such a dangerous job as robbery, his heart remained pure
filled with pious thoughts and emotions. </p>

<p>Preparation was made for revolt to take place in February 1915. In the first
week (of Feb. 1915) he along with Pingle and some other friends went to Agra,
Kanpur, Allahabad, Lucknow, Meerut and other places to meet people and consult
them about the coming revolt. Finally the day for which they waited so long was
drawing near. February 21, 1915 was the day fixed for launching the revolt all
over India. All preparations were being made according to that. But at the same
time a rat was sitting at the root of the tree of their hopes branches was
nibbling at it. Four or five days before (the appointed date) it was suspected
that every thing would be ruined because of the betrayal by Kirpal Singh.
Because of that suspicion Kartar Singh asked Rash Behari Bose to change the
date of the revolt to February 19 instead of 21. Even after doing that Kirpal
Singh came to know this. The result of the presence of one traitor within the
revolutionary group was dangerous and grave. Ras Behari Bose and Kartar Singh
had no real way to keep their plans secret. The misfortune of India can be the
only reason for all this. </p>

<p>Kartar Singh reached Ferozepur with his fifty or sixty colleagues according
to the place. He met with his friend soldier Havaldar and talked to him about
the revolt. But Kirpal Singh had already spoiled everything. Indian soldiers
were disarmed. Arrests were made on a mass scale. Havaldar refused to help.
Efforts of Kartar Singh were unsuccessful. He went to Lahore disappointed. The
pace of arrests all over Punjab was quickened. Friends began to leave them. In
this situation Ras Behari Bose lay in a house in Lahore in depression. Kartar
Singh too came there and lay down on another cot with his back toward Ras
Behari Bose. They did not say a word to each other, but silently understood
that agony of each others heart. How can we even imagine what they were going
through. Our destiny remained to hit out heads against the gate. But we could
not have the means to try our destiny. </p>

<p>Their only desire was that the way would prolong and they arrived in barrack
number 5 near Sargodha and talked about the revolt again. There they were
caught. They were chained. Fearless revolutionary Kartar Singh was brought to
Lahore (police) Station. He told the police chief there, &quot;Mr. Tomkin, how
about some food??&quot; He was so full of life. Friends and foes were equally
impressed with his mesmerizing personality - happy to see him. He was happy at
the time of his arrest. He often said, &quot;Let me be given a title of
revolutionary after I die bravely with courage. Let people remember me as
revolutionary Kartar Singh.&quot; The trial proceeded. He was only eighteen and
a half at that time. He was the youngest defendant. But the judge wrote about
him, &quot;he is one of the most dangerous among the defendants. During his
stay in America and then in India there is not a single part of this conspiracy
in which he has not played an important role.&quot; </p>

<p>One day his turn came to testify. He admitted everything. He kept delivering
his revolutionary testimony. The judge kept looking at him pressing his pen
between his teeth. He did not write a single word. Later he said only this
much, &quot;Kartar Singh, as yet your testimony has now been recorded. Please
give your testimony lead to? Eye-witnesses tell us that Kartar Singh replied to
the judge in a carefree tone, &quot;you can only hang me, what more can you do?
We are not afraid of that.&quot; That concluded the court proceedings for the
day. The next day again began with the testimony of Kartar Singh. Many judges
thought the day before that Kartar Singh was speaking on the instructions of
Bhai Permanent. They were unable to reach the depth of revolutionary Kartar
Singhs heart. Kartar Singhs testimony was more forceful, more vigorous and like
the previous day it admitted everything. In the end he said, &quot;What
sentence will I receive for my crime? Life-sentence or death/. I would prefer
death, so that I could be born again - as long as the India does not become
free I would be born again and again - and would be hanged for my country. This
is the only last wish I have.&quot; </p>

<p>Judges were very impressed by his bravery. But like an enemy with big heart
they did not call his bravery as bravery but remembered him with shameless
words. Not only they showered abuses on Kartar Singh, but gave him the sentence
to be hanged. He smiled and thanked the judges. </p>

<p>Kartar Singh was locked in his death cell. His grandfather came to see him.
He said, &quot;Kartar Singh, people for whom you are giving your life use
abusive language for your. It does no also seem that the country will benefit
from death. Kartar Singh asked him very softly, &quot;Dadaji, where is (such
and such) relative of ours?&quot;<br>
&quot;He died in plague.&quot;<br>
&quot;And the other one?&quot;<br>
&quot;He died of cholera.&quot;<br>
&quot;So you want that Kartar Singh should be lying on his bed for months
suffering with some sickness and die! Is this death not thousand times better
than that?&quot; His grandfather was speechless. </p>

<p>Today, again the question arises. What good did his sacrifice do? For what
did he give his life? The answer to that is very clear. He died for the
country. His ideal was simple to die fighting in the service of his nation. He
wanted nothing more. He wanted to remain unknown even in his death. </p>

<p>The case lasted for a year and a half. On November 16, 1915 he was hanged.
That day too he was happy as always. His weight too increased. He embraced the
hanging rope with the words, &quot;Victory to Mother India.&quot; </p>

          a scholar of Persian and Urdu. </p>
        <p>L. Har Dayal was actuated by zeal for public welfare from his very 
          boyhood. As a student he led a band of workers from Lahore to help the 
          earthquake victims of Kangra in the beginning of the century. </p>
        <p>L. Har Dayal was blessed with a photographic memory. </p>
        <p>He was always first in his class. In one year he did M.A. in English 
          and broke past records. He passed M.A. in History next year. He was 
          awarded State Scholarship in 1905 besides two other scholarships for 
          higher studies in England. </p>
        <p>In England Shyamji Krishna Verma, a great Indian sociologist and revolutionary,

  <P>He was known for his high character, simplicity, nobility and intellectuality. 
    Due to the high spirit of renunciation, self denial and altruism L. Har Dayal 
    was held in high esteem by all. He was a sincere man who had the courage to 
    live according to his convictions. </p>

<P>He kept two objects before him - knowledge and service.
Being a polyglot he knew so many languages that one can't even imagine. He
intended to devote himseld for the uplift of morals and civic education of his
people. He established &quot;World Fellowship of Faiths&quot; in London. <br>
L. Har Dayal, Bhai Jwala Singh and others instituted six Guru Gobind Singh
Scholarships for higher education at Berkeley in U.S.A. </p>

<P>In 1911, he joined Stanford University (U.S.A.) as a
lecturer in Indian Philosophy. He was awarded Doctorate for his thesis
&quot;Bodhisatva Doctrine&quot; in 1932. </p>

<P>Bhai Parmanand who was then in U.S.A., introduced L. Har
Dayal to the Panjabee immigrants in America, who had an urge to free their
country from the British domination. The leadership of L. Har Dayal gave
strength to the movement. Consequently the Hindustan Ghadar Party was founded
in Yugantar Ashram at San Francisco in Nov., 1913 with Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna
as president, L. Har Dayal as secretary and Pt Kanshi Ram as treasurer. It was
secularism married to revolutionary movement based on the principles of
Liberty-Equality, Fraternity and Justice. It had its Punjab base mainly. The
tremendous energies of L. Har Dayal found an appropriate outlet in the
activities of the Ghadar Party. He had the marvellous spiritual power to turn
ordinary men into heroes and martyrs by the thousand. Whoever came in his
contact was bewitched and magnetised by his wonderful ability and erudition. </p>

<P>Sir Michael O' Dwyer admits, &quot;The Gadar movement was by
far the most serious attempt to subvert British rule in India&quot;. The
Rowlatt Report confirms the above view. </p>

<P>The British Government considered L. Har Dayal as the
fountain-head of revolutionary movement and pressed the United States
Government to deport him. L. Har Dayal was arrested on March 23, 1914 but he
reached Switzerland Via Turkey. Before leaving America he issued a strongly
worded statement to the press to bring out the subservience of the United
States administration to the British Government. </p>

<P>At the outbreak of First World War, Indian Independence
Committee was founded in Berlin in the middle of 1915 with L. Har Dayal and Sh.
B.N. Chattopadhayay as its leading figures.. </p>

<P>He died in Philadelphia on March 4, 1939 while on a Lecture
tour of America. </p>

<p><i>His Views Changed</i> </p>

<P>His views had now undergone a complete change. He began to
look down upon everything Hindu and admired every thing Western. He advised the
British to convert the empire into the British-oriental-African commonwealth in
future. </p>

    OF LIFE LIVED BY BHAGWAN SINGH</p>
  <P> It was in the village of Wring, the P.O. Sirhall now Mohenpur, District 
    Amritsar, Punjab, that I was born at about 4 AM on July 27<sup>th</sup>, 1882. 
    My father was Shri Sarmukh Singh and mother, Srimati Har Kaur. My childhood 
    and adolescence were spent like most village youths playing, learning and 
    assuming certain responsibilities. I am the only surviving adult of nine children, 
    the 3<sup>rd</sup> in line with the two elder sisters and five brothers who 
    all died early in life &amp; a younger sister who did not survive childbirth.</p>

  <p >Our village of about 150 people, though small in size, had two distinctions 
    which other villages within a radius of a couple of miles did not possess. 
    One was a primary school, the other, a liquor store. My main or formal education 
    was under the guidance of my paternal Grandfather, Baba Rattan Singh who was 
    a Hakim, as my father was also. He taught me Sikh History, Punjabi Literature 
    and familiarized me with our Religio-political Traditions. Also I attended 
    the Primary School where I learned Urdu. We had reached the middle of the 
    primer one morning, the lesson was Huq keh mat dar baskar chaldo. Tell 
    the truth fearlessly, rest at that, and keep on going. After noon recess 
    that day, I was late for class. When asked the reason why, I answered: - Mianji 
    Jhanda, I was playing cards with other boys and lost sense of time. For this 
    I was severely punished, I had told the truth, without fear, was content and 
    kept on going for school saw me no more. </p>

  <p ><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Bhagwain Singh started active 
    work in 1907-08 in India. When a warrant was issued for his arrest, he left 
    India and traveled covering Burma, Siam, Malay Straits, Java, Sumarata, Borneo, 
    and Singapore - everywhere preaching nationalism. In Hong Kong, he was a priest 
    at the central Sikh temple from March 1910-1913. He worked in the army. Except 
    for a few subedaras, the entire army and officers were ready to take up the 
    cause for Indian independence. In May 1913, he found himself organizing Indians 
    in British Columbia Canada. Within two months, he was arrested and was released 
    on a two thousand dollar bond, and within five months he was deported. </FONT></p>
  <p ><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is what historian Harish 
    K.Puri on page 58 in his book Ghadar Movement wrote: "The arrival of Gyani 
    Bhagwan Singh in Vancouver in the early months of 1913 give a real spurt to 
    a revolutionary political movement in Canada. Bhagwan Singh had been a sikh 
    priest in the Gurudwaras at Perak in the Federated Malay States and at Hong 
    Kong, and was an 'orator' of great merit. He was the first man to deliver 
    vigorous revolutionary diatribes against the British rule, both from the 'pulpit' 
    and in open religio-social congregations of the immigrants. He had been considerably 
    influenced by the revolutionary nationalist thinking of his time through his 
    speeches in the Sunday congregations, punctuated with quotations from the 
    scriptures, he alluded to the sikh history of crusades and the war poetry 
    of the tenth Guru. He embellished these with his own passionate poetical compositions 
    and asked his people to adopt the Revolutionary Nationalist salutation-Bande 
    Mataram - and filled his audience with revolutionary ideas. </FONT></p>
  <p ><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He was externed from Canada within 
    three months of his arrival. The special tribunal in Lahore Conspiracy Case 
    Judgment, rightly observed that Vancouver became the first centre of seditious 
    propaganda among Indians, until it was eclipsed by that of California with 
    the launching of Ghadar Movement." (This was extracted from the judgment, 
    Lahore Conspiracy Case, Home Political A, Proceedings, October 1915,No.91) 
    Also it was Bhagwan Singh who pursued Maulvi Barak Tullah to accompany him 
    to USA to work for the Ghadar Party. When Lala Hardyal was forced to leave 
    USA, Bhagwan Singh and Barak Tullah filled in as president and vice-president 
    of the Ghadar Party. As a president Bhagwan Singh traveled through Japan, 
    north and South China, Korea, Manchuria, and the Philippines. When America 
    entered the war he was among the first ones to be arrested and his bail had 
    been set at $25,000, the highest amount of any. The trial lasted six months 
    but Bhagwan Singh stayed in jail allowing others their liberty. There is much 
    more untold story about my grandfather and all I'm asking is giving him a 
    due recognition at every phase befitting the subject 90th Anniversary of Ghadar 
    Movement. </FONT></p>

  <p  align=center style='text-align:center'>DEPORTATION OF BHAI BHAGWAN SINGH</p>
  <P> Bela Singh, a staff member of the Vancouver branch of the Immigration of 
    Canada visited India and while coming back, managed to bring Bhai Bhagwan 
    Singh with him in June, 1913. Bhai Bhagwan Singh served as a priest in Penang 
    Sikh Temple (The first Sikh Temple built outside of India) for some time. 
    This temple committee was under the control of British Government of Malaya. 
    Then he left for Hong Kong and served in the Hong Kong Sikh Temple for about 
    three years. He was well educated, orator and gifted poet.</p>

  <P>Among his own contrymen, Bela Singh was considered a traitor. He had his own 
    group of East Indians to work as informers for him. Some people were afraid 
    of him. Some others needed his help to get their friends and relatives waiting 
    at Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai to come to Canada. His immiediate boss 
    was William Hopkinson, an Anglo-Indian (English father and Indian mother). 
    He was born in India, therefore, he could speak a bit of Punjabi and Urdu.</p>

  <P>Bela Singhs ulterior motive was to use Bhagwan Singh against the authorities 
    of the Sikh Temple, Vancouver, he could not get along. His gang members were 
    collecting money monthly from those, who were helped by William Hopkinson 
    and Bela Singh.</p>

  <P> Bhai Bhagwan Singh stayed with Bela Singh for some time. Then he began attending 
    congregations in the Sikh Temple but refused to inform the activities of the 
    authorities of the Khalsa Diwan Society. After sometime Bhai Bhagwan Singh 
    realized the ulterior motive of Bela Singh and walked out. He made some speeches 
    and Khalsa Diwan Society liked his sermons and passed a resolution to offer 
    him a job of priest. Bela Singh and Hopkinson became furious.</p>

  <P>They got him arrested on the charges that he traveled on the false passport 
    under a false name. The Khalsa Diwan Society got him released on bail. They 
    appealed for Habeus Corpus on his behalf.</p>

  <P> Malcolm Reid, the Inspector of Immigration Department, Vancouver and William 
    Hopkinson were distant cousins. Both of them were deadly against Bhai Bhagwan 
    Singh because instead of becoming an informer he joined the Khalsa Diwan Society. 
    They were ready to deport him at any cost. They feared that if on the basis 
    of habeus corpus, he stays in Canada, the Department of Immigration will be 
    insulted. They hatched a plot. William Hopkinson and Bela hid themselves in 
    the dark and sent their man in the temple to ask Bhai Bhagwan Singh to come 
    out because one of his friends was waiting outside. As soon as he came out, 
    the immigration men jumped on him, tied his legs and arms, threw him in a 
    boat at the middle of the night.</p>

  <p class=MsoBodyText align="center">DR. SUNDAR SINGH AND KARTAR SINGH JOIN TOGETHER 
    WITH IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT TO DEPORT BHAI BHAGWAN SINGH </p>
  <P>There was another reason for quick deportation of Bhai Bhagwan Singh. The 
    only Punjabi paper The Sansar was owned and controlled by Dr. Sundar Singh 
    and Kartar Singh Akali (Hundal). One or two pages were edited by Dr. Sundar 
    Singhand Punjabi part of the paper was edited by Kartar Singh.</p>

  <P>They did not have any capital and financial assistance coming from donations 
    and subscription. One day, after the congregation Bhai Bhagwan Singh brought 
    up a point that the paper did not represent the community point of view, therefore, 
    the financial assistance should be stopped. This point brought a clash between 
    Dr. Sundar Singh, Kartar Singh on one side and Khalsa Diwan Society on the 
    other.</p>

  <P>The following issue of the paper came out very aggressively against the authorities 
    of the Khalsa Diwan Society and The Guru Nanak Mining and Trust Company Ltd. 
    The whole Sikh community became furious and sopped financial assistance. The 
    case was registered in the law court about the ownership of the paper.</p>

  <P> Now William Hopkinson and Bela Singh found an opportunity to create another 
    friction in the community. The immigration as well as editors of the paper 
    had one common cause to get rid of Bhai Bhagwan Singh. They joined against 
    Khalsa Diwan Society.</p>

    D.C. </P>
  <P>Dear Sir and Brother: -</p>



<P> This will
introduce to you Mr. Bhagwan Singh, one of our Hindu brothers in danger of
deportation on account of his activities in the interest of his fellows in
India.</p>

<P> You will
recall resolutions unanimously adopted by the Chicago Federation of Labor and
sent to you under date of July 22<sup>nd</sup>, also resolutions adopted by the
A. F. of L. and presented to you by President Gompers. Also your letter of July
24<sup>th</sup> (No. 5465/1) in reply to our resolution and setting forth four
paragraphs, concluding that the matter would receive your careful consideration
when the records come up for final consideration.</p>

<P> Therefore,
would you kindly give the brother and his delegation sent by the Pacific coast
Hindustani Association an early hearing in order that they may lay the true
facts before you. I might further add that we have made an investigation and secured
a report from San Francisco from which the sentiment is fast developing amongst
the trade unionists of this city that the English government has been allowed
too much latitude in this country in prosecuting and persecuting these
unfortunate people.</p>

<P> Thanking
you ion advance for the consideration of this request, and with our best wishes
for the Department of Labor, and yourself, we beg to remain,</p>

        
   Most respectfully,  
   CHICAGO FEDERATION OF LABOR,  
   (Signed) Secretary.

    <A name=barakatullah></A><B>Mahomed Barakatullah&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><A
href="gadarphoto.html#barakatullah">(link to photo)</A> </H3>
  <P>This paper differs from the others described in this chapter in that it was 
    published by a Mohomedan for Mahomedans, while all the others are Hindu publications. 
    It was started in Tokio, Japan, early in 1910, by Mahomed Barakatullah, to 
    whose previous activities in New York reference is made in Chapter IX (see 
    pages 218 and 221). Barakatullah was born about 1864, the son of Munshi Shaikh 
    Kadratullah, a Bhopal State servant who died about 1876. Barakatullah, who 
    was a very clever youth, left home about 1883 and was employed as a tutor 
    in Khandwa and later in Bombay. After some years he went to England, and was 
    in Liverpool in 1895. Here he made the acquaintance of Sirdar Nasrullah Khan 
    of Kabul, brother of the present Amir, and he is said to have arranged to 
    supply the Amir through him with information regarding English affairs and 
    to have sent a weekly news-letter to the Amir's agent at Karachi from 1896 
    to 1898. In 1897 he was in London and attended meetings of the Muslim Patriotic 
    League. Barakatullah went to America about 1903, and, as mentioned in the 
    passage cited above left in February, 1909, for Japan, having been appointed 
    Professor of Hindustani in the University of Tokio. </P>
  <P>The tone of the Islamic Fraternity was not at first particularly objectionable 
    though from the beginning it advocated a rather militant pan- Islamism. In 
    June, 1911, Barakatullah left Tokio to visit Constantinople and Cairo. He 
    arrived at Petrograd on July 5th, and the same day sent a letter to Krishnavarma 
    in Paris requesting him to communicate with him. He returned to Tokio in October 
    1911, and resumed the publication of his paper. He had left it in the hands 
    of a German named F. Schroeder and a Japanese named U. Hatano, but they failed 
    to bring out the August number, and he started again with the issue dated 
    September. In this number a writer calling himself &quot;Plaindealer&quot; 
    refers to a great pan-Islamic Alliance that may be formed some day, including 
    Afghanistan which he calls &quot;the future Japan of Central Asia.&quot; All 
    that is required is a leader, and that leader, he says, &quot;will arise in 
    Central Asia, probably in Afghanistan,&quot; whereupon, &quot;the firing of 
    an Afghan gun will give the signal for the rising of all Islam as soon as 
    she is ready and willing to open her gates for believers to fight under the 
    green banner of the prophet, or under her own.&quot; </P>
  <P>Most of the December, 1911, number was devoted to a description of the formal 
    conversation to Islam of three Japanese, U. Hatano (the young man who undertook 
    to edit the paper in Barakatullah's absence), his wife, and her father, whose 
    name is given as Baron Kentaro Hiki. This was described as the first conversation 
    to Islam in Japan; the ceremony took place at Barakatullah's house and was 
    performed by him, and he appeared to regard it as the fore-runner of a great 
    Japanese conversation. In 1912, the editor became at once more fluent in his 
    use of the English language and more anti-British in his tone. The March number 
    contains an article on &quot;The Situation in the Balkans,&quot; in the course 
    of which the editor, after quoting a passage from the Spectator, says &quot;A 
    Roman poet who lived two hundred years before Christ described the Anglo-Saxons 
    of his time as the seawolves whose home was the ocean, whose friend was the 
    storm and who lived on the pillage of the world. Two thousand years have elapsed 
    since, and yet the predatory instinct of the race is not softened. If anything 
    at all has been added to it, it is the refinement of the hypocrisy which sharpens 
    the edge of brutality.&quot; </P>
  <P>Owing to the strong anti-British attitude adopted by Barakatullah the entry 
    of the paper into India was prohibited under the Sea Customs Act on 6th July, 
    1912, and the character of the paper having been brought to the notice of 
    the authorities it was suppressed by the Japanese Government in October, 1912. 
  </P>
  <P>In September, 1912, copies of a paper called El Islam began to appear in 
    India. This paper, which was reported in the Islamic Fraternity to have been 
    started in January, 1912, purported to be devoted to the work of the Islamic 
    religion. The nominal editor was the Japanese convert mentioned above, who 
    now called himself by the half Mahomedan name of Hasan U. Hatano. El Islam, 
    however, began to appear regularly only after the suppression of the Islamic 
    Fraternity, and it soon became apparent that Barakatullah was simply using 
    it to continue his political propaganda. The importation of this paper into 
    India was accordingly prohibited in the same way on 22nd March, 1913. </P>
  <P>In June 1913 copies were received in India from the Far East of a pamphlet 
    in Urdu entitled &quot;The Sword is the last resort.&quot; It was lithographed, 
    and the handwriting, like the style, closely resembled Barakatullah's. The 
    pamphlet refers to the alleged atrocities in the Balkan war and other misfortunes 
    of Islam. The blame for all these evils is laid on England. Mahomedans are 
    enjoined to form secret societies and endeavour to annihilate the oppressive 
    English who are robbing and plundering in India. They should endeavour to 
    destroy the feeling of fear of the English which is &quot;a spider's web woven 
    with deceit.&quot; Those Indian spies who are faithful to the English should 
    be picked out and killed, and the burning alive of 5,000 Muslim women should 
    be avenged by setting fire to 50,000 English homes. The writer goes on to 
    say that, &quot;the English have spread the organisation of the Criminal Investigation 
    Department far and wide. The mullahs in mosques, pujaris in temples, prostitutes, 
    street hawkers, shop- keepers, teachers are now connected with the Criminal 
    Investigation Department.&quot; Indians should, therefore, make the work of 
    Criminal Investigation Department as dangerous as possible. In view of the 
    European situation, and especially of the possibility of a war between England 
    and Germany, Indians should make preparations now for an armed rising. </P>
  <P>On 31st March, 1914, Barakatullah's appointment in the University of Tokio 
    was terminated by the Japanese authorities, and this was followed by the appearance 
    in India in May of another similar lithographed Urdu leaflet called Feringhi 
    ka Fareb (The deceit of the English). It surpassed in violence Barakatullah's 
    previous productions, and was modeled more on the style of the publications 
    of the Ghadr party of San Francisco with whom Barakatullah now threw in his 
    lot. (See page 239) </P>

    <br>
    The life story of Baba Gurmukh Singh of Lalton Khurd village on the outskirts 
    of Ludhiana presents responses and reactions to life and time of an age. It 
    starts with a venture and runs through a rare chain of adventures. As a simple 
    village youth he set out to seek fortune in foreign lands. Events took place, 
    mostly unforeseeable. He was all energy, a human dynamo. He was active, restless 
    for several decades. He turned a rebel, a revolutionary. No other contemporary 
    of his saw as many places, visited as many countries and faced as many uncertain 
    situations as he did. Gurmukh Singh Garewal was born in 1892 in Lalton Khurd 
    village, Patti Himmat. His parents, Hushnak Singh and Nand Kaur, had two more 
    sons elder to him, Charhat Singh and Atma Singh. The former died during the 
    riots of 1947. The latter lived in the village, married and had only one daughter, 
    Dalbir Kaur. This niece of the Baba, despite old age, pays respectful visit 
    to her paternal village. Hushnak Singh had a small land holding which could 
    not provide enough to the family to survive. He joined army. Gurmukh Singh 
    was intelligent, gifted with self-confidence and good physique. He could easily 
    dominate, even lead fellow students. He matriculated from Mission High School, 
    Ludhiana. He liked Lal Singh of Nandpur who was then planning to go to the 
    USA to study in Berkeley. He, later on, became the legendary specialist in 
    horticulture and agriculture. With a meagre amount he, left home in 1913. 
    He landed in Hong Kong to proceed to Canada. Met Gurdit Singh (Komagata Maru) 
    and joined the desperate travellers. On May 23,1913, they were refused to 
    land at the Vancouver port. The ship turned back to the Bay of Bengal to drop 
    these persons at the Budge-Budge ghat instead of Calcutta docks. Gurmukh Singh 
    and others were fired upon. He was arrested, taken to the Alipur jail. Undergoing 
    mishaps and hard time, he kept his spirits high. He returned to Punjab. By 
    this time he had tasted to bitter side of racialism, colonialism etc.<br>
    <br>
    He turned his anger into rebellion. Kartar Singh Sarabha, Nidhan Singh Chugga, 
    Uttam Singh Hans and Arjan Singh Jagraon planned to work to bring about a 
    revolution for freedom. They hoped army would see their way. It was a desperate 
    move resulting in the Lahore conspiracy case. Gurmukh Singh was arrested, 
    tried and sent to Andamans. He saw real hell during 1917-22. Sensing trouble, 
    he was sent to Trichy. Later, on way to Wardha, he jumped with handcuffs from 
    the train near Nagpur. He met C. Rajagopalachari in Madras, who looked indifferent 
    and kept silent. Not discouraged, he went to Hazur Sahib, could stay hardly 
    for a week as he caused suspicion. Baba Nidhan Singh helped him with money 
    and advised him to take to safety.<br>
    <br>
    He returned to Punjab and stayed at Langeri village in Hoshiarpur district 
    at the farm-house of Bhai Piara Singh. He was a pious person who visited Afghanistan 
    to preach ideals of Sikhism. Teja Singh Sutantar, already doing this work, 
    accepted Gurmukh Singh to join him. Master Udham Singh Kasel also joined them. 
    Between 1922-24, Baba Gurmukh Singh stayed there. Meanwhile, Santokh Singh 
    was busy with his Punjabi paper (^Kirti^) and Rattan Singh Dabba with his 
    hand-written press-adventure. They had returned from Russia after getting 
    training in spreading socialism. Gurmukh Singh was much impressed. He, too, 
    wanted to leave for Russia, which he did. He had Baba Prithvi Singh (Lalru) 
    with him. Gurmukh Singh was dare devil, Prithvi Singh cautious and cool. He 
    moved around in Soviet Russia, met many revolutionaries, attended camps, etc. 
    On an impulse he left for America. It is surprising to learn how could a youth 
    without much material means and devoid of professional training, could muster 
    such courage! In California he made contacts, reviewed the post-Ghadar situation, 
    raised funds, reorganised the broken chain and enthused patriots. The farm 
    of Kishan Singh of Gahaur was central place. Hazara Singh Janetpura, Puran 
    Singh, Niranjan Singh Pandori, Surat Singh Chetanpur, Hazara Singh Hamdam 
    were of real help to him. The years from 1929 to 35 were most turbulent for 
    this Ghadri Baba. He was arrested by the Federal government, patriotic activists 
    got him released on bail. Later, he left for Europe. Moving through half of 
    Europe, he reached Kenya on a fake passport. He came to India via West Asia. 
    He watched the Karachi session of the AICC, met leaders and was disappointed 
    with the poor pace of movement. Returned disappointed, but not disheartened. 
    He liked an anti-British Afghan King Oman Ullah, who was replaced by Nadir 
    Khan. Nadir Khan got Baba arrested. Through common friends, his flight to 
    Russia was materialised. He visited several East-European countries and Soviet 
    Republics. He met Oman Ullah at Rome. Ultimately finding favourable avenues, 
    he staged a come back to Lahore by long sea and land routes. Here he worked 
    incognito for Lal Dhandora. Living as rebel was playing with fire. He was 
    arrested, tried and sentenced to jail. He was moved from one jail to another 
    till February, 1946. Riots, Partition, post-Independence bloodbath and mass-uprooting 
    disillusioned him. He remained underground from 1948 to 1952, turned more 
    bitter. He activated the Kisan Sabha. He finally took to raising a memorial 
    at Jalandhar: Desh Bhagat Yadgaar.&nbsp;&nbsp;He worked and died to realise 
    this sentimental dream. <br>
    <br>
    He passed away on March 13, 1977, and was duly cremated at his ancestral village, 
    Lalton Khurd. He ranks among the pioneers of freedom movement. <br>

  <H3><B><A name=kanshi></A>Shaheed Kanshi Ram</B> (<A href="gadarphoto.html#kanshi">link 
    to photo</A>)</H3>
  <P> Shaheed Kanshi Ram was born at Village Marauli, (Ropar) Punjab on October 
    13th, 1883. He passed his 10th class from Patiala. After he concluded his 
    education in 1902, he traveled to America in search of livelihood. Early in 
    his life, he had an occupation of a laborer, but he worked hard and became 
    a very rich person. After he became successful, he was not a greedy man. He 
    often contributed thousands of dollars to the Gadar party. Kanshi Ramm's home 
    was the center of conversations; hence, it became the center of discussion 
    for freedom-seeking leaders on the topic of revolutionary literature sent 
    by Madam Koma. On occasion, he would have meetings with Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna 
    and other Gadri Babas such as the intellectual Lala Hardyal. In these meetings, 
    the Gadar party was formed. Kanshi Ram became the treasurer of the party and 
    member of the trio commission to maintain the secrecy of the party. Their 
    goal was to establish an India independent of British rule. To help them fulfill 
    their goal, it was decided to publish a newspaper entitled &quot;Gadar&quot; 
    which spread the word of freedom. They sent the publication throughout the 
    world. Once Kanshi Ram realized the magnitude of the affairs in India, he 
    departed for India in 1914 to help fight for the cause. Due to the efforts 
    of these men who fought for liberty, India attained independence on August 
    15th, 1947 thanks to the sacrifices of the great Gadri Babas. For his treasonous 
    acts against the British empire, Kanshi Ram was hung, sadly, on March 27th, 
    1915.<BR>

        <P>Taraknath Das left India to evade imprisonment in 1905 and eventually 
          reached Tokyo to study at the University there. His pro-Indian activity 
          in Japan was objected to by the British Ambassador and fearing extradition, 
          Das crossed over to Seattle, Washington in 1906. He had literally to 
          work his way up till Vancouver U.S. Immigration station. Das got his 
          B.A. in Political Science and Economics from the University of Washington, 
          Seattle in 1910 and his M.A. next year. He then secured a fellowship 
          at the University of California for his Ph.D. Dangerous politics interrupted 
          his studies, and he had to wait for his Ph.D. till 1924. Meanwhile, 
          however, Das was admitted to U.S. citizenship on January 5, 1914. It 
          should be conceded, however, that in his agitation work in America Taraknath 
          Das was anticipated (though with less success) by a few others, the 
          Pan-Aryan Association of New York (1960) established by Maulvi Barkatulla 
          and S. L. Joshi appears to be the earliest Indian organization with 
          some political purpose. It did not survive Barkatulla's departure for 
          Japan early in 1909. Mention should also be made of New York's Indo-American 
          National Association, founded in 1907. Ramnath Puri started his Urdu 
          weekly, the Circular of Freedom, from California in 1907. It became 
          defunct within a year. The Committee for the Management of Sikh Diwans 
          and Temples of Vancouver with branches elsewhere in Canada and the USA 
          was also an early organization. </P>

  </TABLE>
  <P>Before the end of 1970 Taraknath Das, who after wards became of much greater 
    importance than Ram Nath Puri, was already associated with the Vancouver branch 
    of the movement. He is mentioned in the Circular of Freedom as one of the 
    treasurers of the Indian Association, and not long after that periodical came 
    to an end he started his own paper, the Free Hindusthan. An account of this 
    paper and of Taraknath's earlier career is given in Chapter IV (see page 119). 
    Being a Bengali he was unable to talk to the Sikhs in their own language, 
    and his paper was unintelligible to the great majority as few of the Sikhs 
    could read a word of English. His influence at the time for harm was therefore 
    considerably less than might be inferred from the language of his paper, but 
    there is no doubt that, such as it was, it was inimical to the British Government 
    and prepared the ground for the serious trouble which arose later. </P>
  <P><B>Appeal to the Sikhs </B></P>
  <P>That Taraknath Das intended to appeal to the Sikhs, especially those connected 
    with the army, is clear from the following extract from the Free Hindusthan

  <p>Partap Singh was born on October 27, 1882 to Shrimati Jaswant Kaur and Shri Deva Singh of the village Moelawahidpur, Dist. Hoshiarpur, Punjab, India. He got his primary education in his village, middle school at Garhshankar and high school from Govt. High School, Rahon, Dist. Jallandar. He was very interested in history and geography. He had read that America and Canada were very prosperous and progressive countries. He asked his parents if he could go to Canada. His parents were very religious people. They told him that if Sant Atar Singh Masutana would bless him to go to Canada, then they have no objection. According to his parent's wishes, Partap Singh appeared before Santji and told him of his desired to go to Canada. Santji gave him his blessing and rather stressed that he must go to Canada because he was very much needed there by his countrymen and would be very successful whatever in his life's missions. He stayed with Sant Atar Singh for five days and learned about Sikhism and the teachings of honesty and hard work. He was given the name Dharm Singh by Santji. With due respect to both his parents and Santji, he used the name: P.S.Dharm Singh for his business in Canada. He followed Santji's advice for the rest of his life. </p>
  <p>He came to Canada in April 1905. He noticed that Indian workers, especially Punjabis were treated badly and with hatred by the whites. The majority of the workers were illiterate, used to smoke, drink and their work ethics were poor. The first thing Partap Singh did was to spread the message of honest work and dignity. He became so popular with Punjabi workers and they started respecting him so much, that they felt proud to go to work through him. He also became very popular with workers from other countries because of his work ethics and honesty. Canadian businesses and farms started hiring workers form him. </p>
  <p>P.S. Dharm Singh believed and followed Sikhism all his life. He felt the need to built a Gurdwara in Canada and America and wrote a special letter of request to Santbabaji Atar Singh asking him to come to Canada. Santji asked his special follower, Sant Teja Singh MA,LLB, who was studying at Teachers College, Columbia University in New York during 1908 to meet P.S.Dharm Singh in Canada after he finished his studies. Sant Teja Singh stayed with Partap Singh in Canada for two years (1908-1910).With his loving and impressive preaching, Sant Teja Singh converted hundreds of Punjabis to Amritdhari. Wealthy Canadians and Americans became so impressed with the Sikhdhari worker's work ethics and honesty, that they especially started asking S.Partap Singh to send only Sikhdhari workers to their factories and farms. More and more workers continued to become Sikhdharis. In 1910, Sant Teja Singh helped Partap Singh to built first Gurdwara in Vancouver B.C., Canada under the management of Khalsa Dewan Vancouver. </p>
  <p>Punjabi workers in California were very impressed by Partap Singh's efforts to improve Punjabi workers lives in Canada that they requested that he build his headquarters in Stockton, California. Workers in California showed S. Partap Singh so much respect and affection, that he again felt need to built Gurdwara in Stockton, California. He wrote a letter to Sant Teja Singh requesting that he to come to Stockton, California. In 1912, Sant Teja Singh came to Stockton. People came in large numbers from Canada and America to welcome Santji. Under Sant Teja Singh's presence, Doaba Sikh American Education Society and Pacific Coast Khalsa Dewan Society Stockton were established. During the Stockton Gurdwara foundation ceremony, S.Partap Singh, Canadian, Moelawahidpur and S.Harnam Singh, Bhajjal donated large sums of money to build the gurdwara. Lots of money was also given by other sangat. At the same time thousands of U.S. dollars were collected to build Khalsa High School at Pur Heeran, Dist. Hoshiarpur through the Khalsa Educational Society. </p>
  <p>During S.Partap Singh's stay in Canada, he continued to spread and preach Gursikhi and freedom spirit in the mind of Punjabis and hatred against slavery in India. He was always very interested in spreading education in Punjab, especially to educate girls. He continued to send money to Punjab for educational purposes through Chief Khalsa Dewan, Amritsar. In September 1912, S.Partap Singh returned to Punjab and also in 1912, Raja Mohinder Partap, Bhai Dashontha Singh Dhada and other Gadari Babas returned to India to start freedom revolution against the British rule. During the summer of 1913, freedom fighters from America and Canada would meet S. Partap Singh in his village, Moelawahidpur, at night to discuss their plans of action against British rule. Unluckily, a traitor gave information to British government regarding their plans of action. The British government stated arresting freedom fighters and putting them in jails. S.Partap Singh and Pundit Salig Ram were arrested at Moelawahidpur and put in the central jail in Lahore. While imprisoned, they were tortured for three years. In 1916, the British had to release them because of lack of evidence against them. S.Partap Singh was told by the British authorities that he could not leave his village for three years and had put restrictions on all his activities including lectures, writing in newspapers or meeting with any freedom fighters. A Police chocki was set up at his village, Moelawahidpur, to watch his activities and S. Partap was made to pay all their expenses. Inspite of all these restrictions, he continued the freedom struggle along with other freedom lovers. During the house arrest period, he built a Gurdwara in his village. S. Partap Singh created Punchati raj in his village and all village legal matters were resolved locally with no cases going to the government court. He also employed a teacher to go to village homes to motivate villager to start educating their girls. </p>
  <p>During Feb.1920, the British lifted restrictions on S. Partap's movements. He was invited by Shodi Pritam Singh Anandpuri to visit Anandpursahib, which he gracefully accepted. Later as a Jathedar, he made many good changes at Anandpur Gurdwara. He went to jail many times during freedom struggle. In 1924, he was again released from jail and after his release SGPC Amritsar made him again Jathethar of Takhat Shri Kashgarh Sahib. He served faithfully at this position for almost 20 years. With the help of Sant Harnam Singh and Sant Hari Singh Kaharpuri, Partap Singh successfully built the beautiful Takhat Keshgarh Sahib Gurdwara. </p>
  <p>After 20 years of service at the above holy place, he returned to his village. He spent most of his time doing kirtan gurbani and prayer. On Feb.9, 1947 about 2.30 PM, he called his son and told him that he was ordered by the Almighty to leave this world and Sant will come to take him. &quot;Send me with him with a smile and no on will cry on my departure.&quot; On Feb.10, 1947 at exactly 2.30 PM while Partap Singh was laying in his bed he again told his son who was sitting by his bed side, and Jathedarji smiled and said Santji had come and his soul left his body peacefully. According to his wishes, Santsamelan was done on Feb.21, 1947. All prominent Sants and Akali leaders came to celebrate his life achievements and to pay homage and show their respect to this freedom fighter gadaribaba named Jathedar Partap Singh. To show further respect to him, SGPC Amritsar inducted the Partap Singh, Canadian portrait and life history into the Central Sikh Museum at the Golden Temple, Amritsar. S. Baldev Singh Sibia, Acting Chairman SGPC, conducted this historical ceremony. Jathedar Partap Singh's life history is also written and published by the Information Department of Punjab Government in a book called Freedom Fighters from district Hoshiarpur (Jila Hoshiarpur De Sutantarta Sangramis) under the title AMAR SAHID on page 91 along with his photograph. </p>

  <p class="style4"><a name="GhadriBabaMangoo"></a>Ghadri Baba Mangoo Ram Mugowalia</p>
  <p align="center" class="style4">By Mark Juergensmeyer</p>
  <p> Late Bhai Nahar Singn, and eminent historian, took some material from C.I.D. file no. 1273 of 1915 and sent it to Desh Bagat Yadgar committee. It was about Sh. Mangoo Ram a great ghadarite.</p>
  <p> The above mentioned files says:</p>
  <p>N. 6271 </p>
  <p> &ldquo;Mango chamar, of village Mugowal, police station Mahalpur, district, Hoshiarpur. Information was received in the summer of 1915 he was about to leave Sanfrancisco for India via Shanghai and Manila with Narinjan Das of Pharwala. The last two are emissaries of Ram Chand, Peshwari, and have reached Japan in July 1915. Mangoo Ram is said to be dangerous. He seems to have changed his mind about returning, for he was reported in September 1915 still in U.S.A. </p>
  <p> Bhai Nahar Singh himself wrote that Sh. Mangoo Ram was one of the frontline Ghadarites, who along with Baba Hari Singh Usman took the responsibility of sending ARMS to the Ghadrites in India. The story of getting weapons from German counsel and the voyage of MEWAK is described 44 to 55. </p>
  <p> &ldquo;I would suggest you to personally go to the village Mugowal and meet the Bradari of Mongoo and ask them to perpetuate his memory.&rdquo; </p>
  <p> Hereby we are giving some thing more about this eminent personality. These are extracts from &ldquo;Religious Rebels in the Punjab&rdquo; written by &ldquo;Mark Juergensmeyer&rdquo; He is well known Political scientist. </p>
  <p align="right"> Editor </p>
  <p> There are not many Scheduled Caste persons in the Gadar movement, however; Sh. Mangoo Ram recalls only one other Chamar besides himself. Initially Sh. Mangoo Ram played only a minor role in the organization, but in 1915 he volunteered to be one of five Gadarites to participate in a dangerous mission involving smuggled weapons shipped from California to Pujab.&nbsp; He was chosen for the task by the man whom he identified as the &quot;Leader of the Ghadar party at that time,&quot; Sohan Singh Bhakna.&nbsp; The secretary of the Ghadar party, whom he remember as&nbsp; &quot;Godha,&quot; sent the five to Los Angeles where they boarded an intermediary boad after collecting all their personal identification.&nbsp; For the rest of the saga, Sh. Mangoo Ram would be known by a Muslim Pseudonym, Nizamuddin. </p>
  <p> According to Sh. Mangoo Ram, the intermediary boat took them to the Secrorro [sic] islands to rendezvous with the weapons boat, but after thirteen days a military ship from Sydney, the &ldquo;man of war,&rdquo; discovered them. Only through the timely intervention of an American warship were they spared. They went to Vera Cruz, Mexico, to receive rations. There they finally connected with their weapons boat, the Maverick; they joined the crew, took on giant turtles for food, and headed for India. They were halted again in Hawaii, where Sh. Mangoo Ram witnesses the eruption of volcanoes. Free again, they advanced a bit further, perhaps to Java or New Caledonia there the Japanese, on behalf of the British, imprisoned them for one yea. Eventually, the British decided to hand them for one year. Eventually, the British decided to hang them, but at midnight the night before they were to be hanged at dawn, fate intervened. The Germans spirited them away in the dark, and the five went their separate direction Harnam das and Charan Das to Bangkok; the others, including Sh. Mangoo Ram, to Manila. But again, according to Sh. Mangoo Ram&rsquo;s memory, the intervention of fate altered their plans. A typhoon appeared, and the ship went to Singapore instead, where British spies, Bela Singh and Bhag Singh, turned Sh. Mangoo Ram over to British authorities, who promptly ordered him to be placed before a cannon and shot.&nbsp; Again, however, the Germans whisked for Manila.&nbsp; When Sh.&nbsp; Mangoo Ram arrived in the Philippines he read a news report in the Manila Times indicating that he had been executed for treason by the British in Singapore.&nbsp; Sh. Mangoo Ram assumes that one of his captured colleagues had taken on his name to protect him, and that man had been shot in his place.&nbsp; The news of his alleged death proceeded to the Punjab, where his wife heard the report and promptly married his younger brother, as custom dictated.&nbsp; In the meantime, Sh. Mangoo Ram was sequestered in the Philippines in a series of hideouts on various islands.&nbsp; Members of the Ghadar party were his benefactors during this period, and Sh. Mangoo Ram remembers fondly their hospitality and friendship:&nbsp; he was no longer an Untouchable but a comrade in distress.&nbsp; The war ended&nbsp;in 1918, and the Ghadar party was no longer quite the threat it was earlier when&nbsp;it engaged the British by compounding separatism with seditions through its liaison with the Germans.&nbsp; But Sh.&nbsp;Mangoo Ram decided to stay in manila.&nbsp; Nonetheless he met an American, a Mr. Johnson of Marshall field and company (a department store in Chicago), who hired him to work in an embroidery factory making shirts for the American market.&nbsp; After six years of that Sh. Mangoo Ram was ready to return to India.</p>
