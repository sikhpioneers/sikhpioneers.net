      <p> </p>
      <p>The first Sikhs who visited Canada were the soldiers of the British Army 
        (the Sikh Lancers and Infantry). They passed through Canada ( traveling 
        by train from Montreal to Vancouver) on their way back to India, after participating 
        in the Diamond Jubilee celebration of Queen Victoria in London, England, 
        in 1897. On their way back from Canada to India, they met other British 
        Army Sikh soldiers in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore and told them about 
        the opportunities in Canada, before going back to Punjab, India. A <a href="t_canphot.html#monument"> 
        monument</a> has been erected to their honor at the GURDWARA SAHIB, at 8000

      <p> The four Sikhs who arrived on the Nippon Maru the other day were permitted 
        yesterday to land by the immigration officials. The quartet formed the 
        most picturesque group that has been seen on the Pacific Mall dock for 
        many a day. One of them, Bakkshlled [sic] Singh, speaks English with fluency, 
        the others just a little. They are all fine-looking men, Bakkshlled Singh 
        in particular being a marvel of physical beauty. He stands 6 feet 2 inches 
        and is built in proportion. His companions-Bood [sic] Singh, Variam [sic] 
        Singh and Sohava Singh-are not quite so big. All of them have been soldiers 
        and policemen in China. They were in the Royal Artillery, and the tall 
        one with the unpronounceable name was a police sergeant in Hong Kong prior 
        to coming to this country. They hope to make their fortunes here and return 
        to their homes in the Lahore district, which they left some twenty years 
        ago.<br>

        in 1906 and by the 1940s, farmed large tracts of farm land in Arizona. 
      <p> "Arizona has many large cotton farms. But many of the farmers started 
        on a small scale. Diwan Singh was one of the more colorful pioneers. Born 
        in India, he immigrated to America in 1906. Singh was a common laborer 
        when he drifted into Casa Grande in 1924. He wanted to farm but was penniless. 
        The only land he could get had hard, alkali soil. But with a horse and 
        a mule he plowed 80 acres and planted cotton. Singh did well. In 1932 
        he was able to buy the first Caterpillar tractor in the Casa Grande area. 
        By the 1940s he was farming 9,000 acres of land." (<i>Arizona's Heritage</i>

      <i><strong>"Hindu Alley" Men Were Peaceable (1906-1922)</strong> 
      <p> For more than 15 years Astoria had a Hindu Alley, a block of houses 
        on Birch Street near the old Hammond Mill in Alderbrook. 
      <p> 
        <center>
          <img src="images/alley3.gif" width=434 height=302 border=0 alt="Hindu Alley"> 
        </center>
        <font size="-1">Contemporary photo of "Hindu Alley", Astoria (Photo by 
        T.S.Sibia, 1999)</font> Old-time Astorians estimate that there may have 
        been nearly 100 Hindus from India among the 600 employees of different 
        nationalities working for the mill, which burned Sept. 11, 1922, before 
        the great Astoria fire in December of that year. There were also Greek, 
        Japanese, and Arab workers. The Mohammedan Arabs and the Hindus were often 
        confused. 
      <p> Mention the Hindus to an old-timer, and the immediate response is, "Yes, 
        I remember them. They all wore white turbans. They were tall men. They 
        were good wrestlers." But beyond that very little is commonly known about 
        the Hindus, because, as most of the immigrant groups in the early days, 
        they kept to themselves. 
      <p> No one could know exactly when the Hindus came to Astoria, but from 
        piecing together the information from about 20 old-time Astorians interviewed, 
        this reporter has concluded that they probably came in 1906. 
      <p>According to Cecil Moberg, who grew up in Alderbrook, there were 12 bunk 
        houses along the waterfront between 51st and 52nd Streets on Birch where 
        the most of Hindus lived. He said that about four men lived in each house. 
      <p> Hattie Spencer said that 12 Hindus lived in the house behind her home 
        at 4777 Cedar, renting it for a dollar each for a month. 
      <p> For the "Hindu Alley," bunkhouses, there was a central cook house, said 
        Chris Simonsen, where they ate Indian food. He remembers their making 
        chupatti pancakes patting the dough between their hands. He also said 
        that they would only buy live chickens, and only roosters, not hens. The 
        other Hindus were all single men who came to work for the mill. 
      <p> Although most were single men, Mrs. Spencer remembers hearing that "at 
        one time there were two Hindu women dressed as men who worked at the mill 
        for quite a while with the men, until they were found out." But that was 
        all she knew. There were four children in the Hindu family. Moberg said 
        that the two older boys, Kapur and Budha Singh, attended school with him. 
      <p> "The boys had such beautiful white teeth," he remarked, recounting that 
        one day the boys explained how they cared for their teeth: "They picked 
        a willow twig from the swamp and used it to clean their teeth." 
      <p> <b>Feared Hindus</b> 
      <p> Many of the old-timers reported that as children, they were afraid of 
        the Hindus. 
      <p>"We thought they were terrible coming with their turbans," said Mrs. 
        Spencer. "We were afraid of them at first. But my dad said, "They have 
        to make a living as the rest of us. We are foreigners, too." 
      <p>"As children, we were afraid of them because they were great big men," 
        Moberg added. 
      <p>Chris Simonsen, who lived across from the bunkhouses, remembers as a 
        child throwing snowballs at Hindus, trying to knock off their turbans, 
        in about 1910. 
      <p> He also said that men would pick fights with the Hindus when they came 
        home from town on the last street car in the evening. "For the most part, 
        however, the Astoria community considered the Hindus "vastly interesting, 
        and peaceable." "The Hindus kept to themselves and didn't interfere with 
        the whites," said Mrs. Spencer. 
      <p> <b>Agile Wrestlers</b> 
      <p>The Hindus were most known for their prowess and agility in wrestling, 
        back in the days when wrestling was "real honest-to-goodness wrestling," 
        in Bill Wootton's words. 
      <p> They would hold wrestling bouts in Rosenberg Hall, about 11th and Exchange. 
      <p>"They were light-heavyweight champions," Wootton said. "They used scientific 
        holds and used their science and ability to get in and out of the holds." 
      <p>Although many immigrant groups who came to the United States came because 
        they would work for cheap wages, that was not true of the Hindus. 
      <p> Helmer Lindstrom of 4374 Cedar, remembers that the Hindus "never undercut 
        wages" - they would never agree to work for less than the other employees. 
      <p>According to Peters, they worked 10 hours a day, six days a week for 
        128 a week - at least during the period after he arrived in 1916.

      <p> 
      <i>"On September 4, 1907, a mob of about 500 men assaulted boarding houses 
      and mills, forcefully expelling Hindus from Bellingham (Washington)in what 
      is now known as the Anti-Hindu Riot. 
      <p> It began as an attack on two East Indian workers on C Street and turned 
        into a rock-throwing lynching, to 'scare them so badly that they will 
        not crowd white labour out of the mills.' The small police force was overpowered. 
        The next day about 300 Hindus fled Bellingham in fear. 
      <p> The press, some civic leaders and churches denounced the riots. Threats 
        were later made to other groups, though no major riots occurred."

        <font size="+1">Moving Hindu Colony to British Honduras?</font> 
      <p>The government of Canada hatched a conspiracy to please the Asiatic Exclusion 
        League and to keep Canada white. The first step the government of Canada 
        took was to pass "an order in council" on January 8, 1908, to ban the 
        entry of Indians into Canada: "All immigrants seeking entry must come 
        to Canada by continuous journey and through tickets from the country of 
        their birth or nationality or citizenship." Now the government of Canada 
        took the second step and suggested that Indians should voluntarily accept 
        to leave Canada and settle in another British colony-- British Honduras. 
        J.B. Harken, interior minister of the federal government, was authorized 
        to make arrangements for all Indian residents of British Columbia to be 
        sent to British Honduras. The meeting was arranged by William Hopkinson, 
        who was born in India of an English father and a Punjabi mother. He knew 
        a bit of Punjabi and could speak Urdu. Bhai Bhag Singh, president of the 
        Khalsa Diwan Society and Bhai Balwant Singh, priest of the Sikh Temple, 
        were approached by Hopkinson. They could not refuse meeting Harkin. Their 
        meeting was held on October 18, 1908. They were forced to send a deputation 
        of two Sikhs, Bhai Sham Singh and Bhai Nagar Singh, to British Honduras 
        with Harkin and Hopkinson. The deputation reached British Honduras on 
        October 25, 1908, and returned on November 7, 1908. In November a congregation 
        was held at the Sikh temple. The temple was not only the place for worship, 
        it was also the headquarters of the Sikh, Hindu and Muslim laborers. It 
        was the residence and the feeding place for the sick and unemployment 
        laborers from India. The hall of the temple was full. Bhai Sham Singh 
        and Bhai Nagar Singh presented their report. The summary of the report 
        is as follows: "The climate of Honduras is not sustainable. Monthly wages 
        are much lower. Fresh water and milk are not available. Sea water is used 
        for washing and bathing. Lots of mosquitoes, flies and many diseases. 
        Labor is contractual. Some Indians working as contractual laborers are 
        having a miserable life. We were asked to accept a bribe of $3,000 to 
        make a report in favor of settling in British Honduras." The congregation 
        passed a unanimous resolution refusing to go to British Honduras...The 
        result was that on November 23, 1908. J.B. Harkin had to inform the government 
        to the effect that the Sikh delegation was against sending any Sikhs to 
        British Honduras. William Hopkinson did not cease his efforts and the 
        government of British Honduras, Colonel E. John Swayne, was invited to 
        British Columbia to convince Sikhs to go to British Honduras. Colonel 
        Swayne had served in India and knew Punjabi and Urdu. He offered $20 a 
        month and a pension of $10 a month after 10 years' service but still he 
        could not find even one Indian willing to go to British Honduras. Later 
        in December 1908 the government of Canada issued a statement that no Indian 
        was to be sent to British Honduras by force. The question of sending Indians 
        to British Honduras was closed forever.

      <a name="disabused"></a> <b>1909 THE AWAKENING OF THE SIKHS</b>  <i>They 
      refuse to wear medals and titles of slavery.</i> 
      <p></p>
      "The Sikh soldiery is known as the backbone of the British Empire 
      in India. It is gratifying to know that the Sikhs are awakening to the 
      sense that they are nothing better than slaves, and are serving the British 
      Government to put our mother country in perpetual slavery. The religion 
      of the Sikhs is to help the downtrodden and crush tyrants. 
      <p></p>
      On October 3rd, 1909, a very interesting incident took place in Sikh theTemple 
      of Vancouver, B.C., Canada. One Sardar Natha Singh stood up before the 
      assembly and humbly pleaded for the deplorable condition of our countrymen 
      in India and other parts of the world, especially in the British colonies. 
      In conclusion he presented a resolution to the following effect: 
      <blockquote>  "Resolved that no member of the Executive Committee of 
        the Sikh Temple should wear any kind of <a href="t_usphot.html#medals">medals</a>, 
        buttons, uniforms or insignia which may signify that the position of the 
        party wearing the aritcle is nothing but a slave to the British supremacy." 
      </blockquote>      "He clearly argued that the medals they wore signify that they fought 
      for the British as mercenaries against the cause of our fellow-countrymen, 
      or some free people. The medals acquired by serving in the British army 
      ought to be regarded as medals for slavery. The audience solemnly and unanimously 
      accepted the proposal. Sardar Gharib Singh, a member of the committee 
      of the Sikh Temple, and formerly sepoy 2760 in the Fouteenth Sikh Regiment, 
      who wentto China during the Boxer trouble and acquired a medal for chivalry, 
      took off his medal and declared that he should not wear any medal or uniforn 
      acknowledging supremacy of the British. 
      <p></p>
      Later on Sardar Bhag Singh, the Secretary of the Khalsa Divan, who served 
      the Tenth Bengal Lancer Regiment for over five years, made a bonfire with 
      his certificate of honourable discharge. The above incidents are a few 
      of the many genuine proofs of the awakening of the Sikhs. Coming in contact 
      with free people and instituitions of free nations, some of the Sikhs, thought 
      labourers in the North American Continent, have assimilated the idea of 
      liberty and trampled the medals of slavery. There is in this a lesson for 
      the so-called educated people of India and their moderate leaders." <br>

        According to writer Khuswant Singh, this was the first revolt against 
        the British to free India. He also noted that "although nine out of ten 
        of the rank and file of the Ghadar Party were Sikhs and the centres of 
        their activities were Sikh temples, since most of them, were illiterate, 
        most of the leaders were educated Hindus or Muslims. This saved the Ghadar 
        from becoming a militant Sikh movement. In fact, it contributed - not 
        a little - to make the Ghadar the most powerful terrorist movement in 
        the history of India's freedom movement as well as the first one to rise 
        above communal considerations." <br>

      Ottowa Plans to Recognize Paldi, Set Up Sikh Museum <br>
      By Kulvinder Kular <br>
      Vancouve <br>
      Under a major initiative planned by the federal government to further recognize 
      the contribution of immigrant Sikhs in Canada, the first limber mill owned 
      by the community at Paldi on Vancouver Island in the early 20th century 
      will be declared as a national historic site so as to preserve it for posterity 
      as a symbol of Canadian diversity and recognition of its rich heritage. 
      Disclosing this, Minister of Canadian Heritage Sheila Copps told The Link 
      that the Fisheries Minister Herb Dhaliwal and she were working on this project 
      and would be forwarding the application to the selection committee which 
      is scheduled to meet in November next. And getting the approval from a committee 
      of her department should not be a problem... According to records, the Mayo 
      Lumber Mill at Paldi on the Island was set up in 1918 with Mayo Singh and 
      Duman Singh, both hailing from Paldi village in Punjab^s Hoshiapur district, 
      as major shareholders. It had Indian immigrants as workers. The mill was 
      gutted in 1934 but was restarted by Mayo Singh the following year when another 
      shareholder Kapoor Singh parted the company to set up his own sawmill. According 
      to Sheila Copps, Ottowa came out with its special historic sites program 
      two years ago and had already issued a stamp to mark the arrival Sikhs in 
      Canada. Explaining the objective behind this, she said the global thinking 
      has drastically changed at the onset of the 21st century.Some people are 
      fighting for protecting the biodiversity of animal species. To me it is 
      more important to save human diversity. We are losing two languages around 
      the world every month. This should not be happening...<br>

        the University of Claifornia who engaged today in upholding the tradition 
        of the university anent the hazing of freshmen, faced a real problem this 
        afternoon in the form of three Hindu scholars. The three were captured 
        and lined up for hazing, after which a consultation of sophomores was 
        held. 
      <P> Finally it was decided to make them take off their shoes and wade in 
        chemistry pond, explaining to them that they were &quot;bathing their 
        feet turbans to solve the mystery of whin the university's sacred pool.&quot; 
        Then it was decided to unwind theirat might be underneath. To this, however, 
        the Hindus objected and showed fight. The three finally freed themselves 
        from their captors and ran frantically for the president's office with 
        the intention of calling the office of the British consulate at San Francisco 
        for protection. But they were overhauled by members of the senior class, 
        who restored the peace.<BR>
        The three are said to be graduates of Oxford University and are here to 
        take post-graduate work.&quot;<BR>

      <p> <br>
        Dalip Singh Saund was elected a member of the Congress from the 29th Congressional 
        District in California in 1956, "the first Democrat to be elected from 
        his district of Westmorland, California, and the first person of Asian 
        extraction ever elected to Congress in the history of the United States." 
        Saund, who had come to the United States as a student, received a doctorate 
        in mathematics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1924, 
        but he could not get himself a job commensurate with this academic degree 
        because of the prejudice and discrimination against Asians in California 
        prevalent at the time. He wrote: 
      <blockquote>"I was aware of the considerable prejudice against the people 
        of Asia in California and knew that few opportunities existed for me or 
        people of my nationality in the state at the time. I was not a citizen 
        and could not become one. The only way Indians in California could make 
        a living was to join with others who had settled in various parts of the 
        state as farmers. I had met a few Indians from Imperial Valley who had 
        done very well, and so in the summer of 1925 I decided to go to the southern 
        California desert valley and make my living as a farmer."</blockquote>

      <p> <strong><font color=#ff0000>Prabhu Goel and his wife Poonam: DONOR'S 
        GRANT TO BENEFIT GIRLS' EDUCATION IN INDIA</font color></strong><br>
        (by Richard Springer: <i>India-West</i> Staff Reporter). (Reproduced with 
        permission of publishers of <i>India-West</i>.) 
      <p> SANTA CLARA, Calif. - Silicon Valley entrepreneur Kanwal Rekhi has made 
        a $1 million donation for this year and has pledged to donate $1 million 
        dollars for each of the next four years to the Santa Clara, Calif. -based 
        Foundation for Excellence, a nonprofit organization that assists disadvantaged 
        students in India. 
      <p> Rekhi, whose family fled Pakistan and settled in Kanpur after Partition, 
        told India-West Jan. 21 that he has imposed only one condition for his 
        bequest, in the form of stock and worth $5 million over five years. 
      <p> "I want the focus to be on education of girls. That's how you can leverage 
        education for the whole family," said Rekhi, the current president of 
        The IndUS Entrepreneur. 
      <p> "If you educate a boy, you have educated a person. If you educate a 
        girl, you educate a family down the road." 
      <p> FFE was founded in 1994 by private venture capitalist and entrepreneur 
        <strong>Prabhu Goel and his wife, Poonam</strong>. 
      <p> Goel was the founder of Gateway Design Automation, which was acquired 
        by Cadence Design Systems in 1989 for about $80 million. 
      <p> Until Rekhi's contribution, the Goels have been the "only source of 
        funding" for the foundation, FFE president Venktesh Shukla told India-West. 
      <p> "We have never done any fundraisers and are all volunteers," he said, 
        adding that all funds contributed by the Goels have gone entirely to students, 
        in contrast to the situation at some other nonprofit groups where fundraising 
        and administrative costs eat up as much as 70 percent of donations. 
      <p> Shukla, the founder and chief executive officer of Everypath, a company 
        in the business of developing solutions for wireless access to the Internet, 
        said that FFE has awarded about 1,800 scholarships totaling about $800,000. 
      <p> The Goels have agreed to donate up to $10 million, which is being made 
        available "as soon as we need the money," Shukla said. 
      <p> Rekhi's gift, by contrast, "will allow us to scale up," he said. "The 
        sheer magnitude of this donation enables the foundation to think differently 
        about the scope of its activities," he said. 
      <p> "So far we had been content to grow the number of scholarships awarded 
        by the usual 100-200 percent every year. We considered ourselves successful 
        in our mission as we scaled up to grant more than 1,000 scholarships last 
        year to deserving students in India," he said. 
      <p> "The availability of this much money up front challenges us to expand 
        our program much more aggressively. We welcome this challenge." Shukla 
        said that the group will seek to establish an administrative office in 
        Mumbai and possibly set up "regional offices" where volunters can be recruited. 
        The India offices would then handle the paperwork and initial screening 
        process of applicants, with the final awards being made by the Santa Clara-based 
        parent group. 
      <p> "We will also invest more in information technology and in developing 
        a system to minimize the exchanging of pieces of paper between here and 
        India," he said. 
      <p> One thing that will remain the same is the focus on changing the future 
        for talented and needy students in India. Many of the FFE recipients are 
        now in Indian medical and engineering schools. 
      <p> "As a businessman," said Goel, "I wanted to do something that had leverage. 
        These students who complete degrees in medicine or engineering have a 
        bigger impact on the environment from which they came than if they only 
        completed high school." 
      <p> Added Rekhi, "I wanted to do something to educate the poorest who don't 
        have a chance to go to college without assistance and I wanted to support 
        the foundation because there is a lot of volunteer support from the parents 
        in the community." 
      <p> Rekhi, a graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, received 
        his master's in engineering from Michigan Technology University. 
      <p> He co-founded Excelan, which made add-on boards to connect desktop computers 
        into local area networks. The company merged in 1989 with Novell, where 
        Rekhi served as executive vice president and chief technology officer 
        until he became a major venture capital investor, board member and mentor 
        for start-up companies including Exodus Communications, CyberMedia, Xpede 
        and many others.

      <P> Yuba City - For members of the Sikh religious community in Sutter County 
        and across the Sacramento region, the Guru Ram Das Khalsa preschool was 
        a long held dream. 
      <P> For years, many in the 10,000-member Sikh community had talked about 
        opening a school to provide a multicultural education for their children, 
        who were quickly assimilating into American society without learning the 
        language, culture and history of their ancestors. 
      <P> On Sunday, scores of Sikhs gathered to celebrate the opening of the 
        first Sikh school in Northern California. 
      <P> The Guru Ram Das Khalsa school, opened in converted offices at the Sikh 
        Temples in Yuba City, will start as a preschool for children for ages 
        3 to 5. It will eventually expand to serve children in kindergarten through 
        the third grade. 
      <P> <B>The church is building a permanent school on Lincoln Road in Yuba 
        City.</B> 
      <P> &quot;More than anything, we saw that with each generation, our youth 
        was losing touch with their culture,&quot; said Diljit Bains, a real estate 
        developer in the Yuba-Sutter region and a member of the board of trustees 
        for the new school. &quot;I think that culture needs to be put back into 
        the schools to maintain it. &quot; 
      <P> On Sunday, as some the first 30 preschoolers excitedly cavorted on the 
        playground, the proud adults dined on potato samosas, a carrot dessert 
        and eggless cake. 
      <P> For 72 straight hours prior to the celebration, members of the Sikh 
        community had honored the school by praying in alternating shifts-reading 
        from the Guru Granth Sahib, the 1,430-page collection of writing from 
        Sikh holy masters. 
      <P> Dr. Jasbir Kang, a Yuba City physician and another member of the school's 
        board of trustees, said he is pleased that many of the children will be 
        able to learn the native language-Punjabi-of their India-born parents. 
        But he also said the school will have both Sikh and non-Sikh teachers 
        to give pupils a multicultural experience. 
      <P> 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;To be successful in America, you have to have a secular 
        perspective-and at the same time be aware of your own religion and culture,&quot; 
        Kang said. &quot;We are not trying to isolate ourselves. We are adding 
        to the beauty of ourselves. We are adding to the beauty of America. These 
        kids are going to pick up the good from both cultures.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

            <font size="-1">Released April 19, 1999 by Canada Post, the new 46 
            cent stamp features a double-edged sword, a circle and two daggers

            <p> <i>Khanda</i> is a metaphor of divine knowledge, its sharp edges

              thread in Canada's mosaic. Their dream, my dream, has been to get

              made to building Canada. Well, it happened. Only in Canada, eh?"

      <p> <strong><font color=#ff0000> DOSANJH IS BRITISH COLUMBIA PREMIER</font color></strong> 
      <p> Feb. 21,2000 - It was a big day for Punjabis. One of them, Mr. Ujjal 
        Dosanjh today became the Premier of British Columbia, a prosperous and 
        important state [i.e. Province] of Canada. 
      <p> <img src="images/dosanjh2.gif" width=213 height=230 border=0 alt="Dosanjh"> 
      <p> There was thunderous applause when the results were announced. Mr. Dosanjh 
        was present along with his wife Raminder Kaur Dosanjh, and three sons, 
        Pavel, Assem and Ambar, to receive the standing ovation. Mr. Dosanjh told 
        the delegates that the election of a once immigrant worker to such a high 
        place showed the committment of the Canadian people. 
      <p> He talked about his Punjabi background, the role of <a href="gadar.html">Ghaddarite</a> 
        freedom fighters and other political forces committed to social justice 
        and human welfare. He promised to uphold these traditions. 
      <p> Mr. Dosanjh will be sworn in as Prime Minister [i.e. Premier] by the 
        Governor [i.e. Lieutenant Governor], Mr. G Gadown, in Victoria on Wednesday. 
        Five days later he will announce his Cabinet.

      <p> Born in Dosanj Kalan village of Jalandhar district, Mr.Dosanjh belongs 
        to a family of freedom fighters. Mr. Dosanjh, the first Indian to become 
        a Premier of any Canadian state [i.e. Province], said: "My victory is 
        a tribute to the freedom fighters of the <a href="koma.html">Kamagata 
        Maru.</a> They set the pattern for us to fight for freedom and democracy. 
        We salute all freedom fighters and those who cherish social and human 
        values." 
      <p> Asked how he felt as once he was an immigrant worker and how should 
        people in India and Punjab in particular, think about his victory, Mr. 
        Dosanjh said: "I remember my maternal grand father in Bahwa village of 
        Hoshiarpur. He would take us on a wooden cart and tell us stories about 
        Kamagatu Maru, the gurdwara reform movement and about Mahatma Gandhi and 
        Nehru of the freedom movement. Something went deep and influenced my thinking. 
        When I came to Canada after spending sometime in England, I worked hard 
        to earn a living and then became a lawyer, I was always busy in the trade 
        union movement and later the New Democratic Party. Our committment is 
        to social democracy. I salute the country of my origin and my Punjab and 
        the people." 
      <p> "I migrated at the age of 17, but have never forgotten my roots. I have 
        visited Punjab repeatedly and have tried to set up joint ventures with 
        the help of my colleagues. I look forward to doing something tangible 
        for Punjab. We can help in setting up joint ventures in several areas," 
        he added. 
      <p> Mr. Dosanjh said it was true that the first committment was to Canada 
        and British Columbia, but India was there in his heart. "We strongly believe 
        in the unity and prosperity of India, a modern secular democratic India 
        committed to the welfare of its people. We want to see the land of our 
        origin prosperous and any help would be an honour," he said. 
      <p> Mr. Dosanjh is the 34th Prime Minister [i.e. Premier] of British Columbia, 
        the state [Province] born in 1871. His wife Mrs. Raminder Kaur Dosanjh 
        is working and his three sons are studying in universities. The entire 
        family was there to recieve the applause after his election as leader 
        of the New Democratic party.
