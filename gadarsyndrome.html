<BLOCKQUOTE class="style1"><B><I>The Gadar Syndrome: Ethnic Anger and Nationalist 
  Pride</I></B> <BR>By: Professor Mark Juergensmeyer <BR>( Social Science, 
  University of California, Santa Barbara) 
  <P>[Used with permission] <PRE>	In the first decades of this century, California provided the
scene for one of the most bizarre and memorable incidents undertaken by
any ethnic community in the United States: the attempt by a group of
India's expatriate nationals to create a revolutionary army, invade India
by sea, and liberate her from the clutches of British rule.  A quixotic
hope, and a tragic missions, as it turned out.

	The Punjabis who organized it called their movement Gadar
(alternately spelled Ghadar, or Ghadr).  The name means "mutiny" or
"revolt," and their mounting publicity actually led to such an attempt in
1915.  Five boats, loaded with weapons and propaganda, set sail from
various ports in California, financed by the German war effort.  Alas,
most were soon intercepted by the British.  Those that landed were met by
British authorities, and many leaders were hanged.  Others were put on
trial by the American government and many of them were deported.

	Curiously, the members of the movement were more militant than
most of their nationalist compatriots back in India at the time.  Theirs
was an independent movement, existing almost solely in America, and its
ties to India were remarkably weak.  The poignancy of their endeavor is
highlighted by their isolation: a stalwart band of rebels who maintained a
lonely mutiny against British India, half a world away.

	Then why did they do it?  The answers to that question have
ramifications beyond the Gadar incident, for as peculiar as Gadar may
seem, it fits into a pattern of militant nationalism within expatriate
communities that includes Irish nationalists, Chinese and Korean
revolutionaries, and in our time, Iranian militants.  Within the Gadar
case, then, is a syndrome of ethnic anger and nationalist pride, and the
link between them begs to be understood.

	Our explorations lead us in both directions from the Pacific: the
American context and the Indian one.  The Punjab context helps us
understand why the immigrants came to America in the first place: the
economic, social and political turmoil early in this century. The American
context provides a hypothesis to explain how the frustrations of the new
immigrant community were experienced as a double jeopardy, and turned into
Gadar militancy.  The hostility toward the prejudice of North American
whites had identified itself with the nationalist struggle against the
oppression in India.  In America, the new immigrant community was trying
to maintain its self-understanding, and developing its new identity as an
ethnic working class, all in a climate of fear and suspicion.  The
struggle against the oppression in America and in India became fused into
one struggle: Gadar.

	The Gadar identity, then, was a compound of the nationalism and
communalism which they brought from India, and the class consciousness and
ethnic identity which they discovered in America.  The former was a
response to unjust British policies and tensions among Hindus, Muslims,
and Sikhs in the Punjab, and the latter a response to economic and racial
oppression in America.  These elements comprised the mixed motives of the
Gadar movement; they were reflected in the tensions within the
organization, and echoed even in the composition of its membership.

<B>The Mixed Constituency of the Movement</B>

	The Indians who came to the west coast of Canada and the United
States around the turn of the century were mostly Punjabis, illiterate
farmers and laborers, students, and priests.  The Gadar movement was an
amalgam of these; and their social concerns were as varied as their
occupations.

	The movement included political refugees who found North America a
congenial place to speak out against colonial rule.  Har Dayal, the most
visible and outspoken Gadar leader, came to the United States as a
visiting scholar; but he also came because of the greater political
freedom which he perceived America to offer.  Ram Chandra, editor of the
Gadar newspaper, and Barkatullah, an important strategist and liaison,
were also involved in nationalist movements before they came to
America.  The Gadar movement could not have existed without their
intellectual and political leadership, but their role should not be
exaggerated.  Har Dayal, for all his brilliance and charismatic authority,
was an erratic leader, who left the movement and the United States in
1914, before the most critical years of the movement's history.

	Immigrant laborers, farmers, and students provided the bulk of the
movement's support.  Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna, who is considered by some to
be the founder of the Gadar movement, had been a laborer in a lumber mill
in Oregon.  Jawala Singh, a potato farmer near Stockton, California,
helped finance the movement; and Bhawgan Singh, who took over the Gadar
party after the divisions within the party in 1917, was closely linked
with the immigrant workers community as a gyani (priest).  Kartar Singh
Sarabha, the young martyred leader of the cadres who returned to foment an
uprising in the Punjab in 1914-1915, had come to the United States to be a
student at the University of California, Berkeley.
  
	One would think that the immigrant workers and students had put
India behind them.  Even though their ties to their homeland may have been
strong, one would have expected them to be emotionally detached from
colonial oppression, and interested only in their own personal economic
and scholarly achievements.  Thus, the intense involvement of students and
worker sin the movement - their commitment unto death for a nationalist
cause - can only be explained by the infusion of other, more personal,
concerns. 

	Many of these personal concerns were linked with a universal
problem of those in immigrant communities: that of being a stranger in a
strange land.  In the case of the immigrant Punjabis early in this
century, that sense of strangeness was compounded by the experience of
economic hardship and racial oppression.  This may explain some of the
Gadar intensity - the desire to turn tables, and "drive the foreigners out
of India" even as they in North America were the foreigners being driven
out by the whites.

<B>Formative Stages in Gadar Party</B>

In reviewing the development of the Gadar party, one notices a sort of
rebound effect between acts of racial hostility against the immigrant
Punjabis and new developments within the movement.  There is also an
interaction between events in the Punjab and the activities of the
immigrant Punjabis.  The two sets of relationships provide an incendiary
crossfire.

	The sequence of events was as follows: Oppressive British policies
and communal tensions in the Punjab helped encourage migration to Canada
and the United States, where those same issues were exacerbated by new
racial tensions and oppressive policies of the Canadian and American
governments.  Thus, an irony of history emerges: the escape from
colonialism to communalism leads to new forms of oppression and a sharper
sense of ethnic identity and national pride.  

	The chart on the following page indicates events occurring in four
contexts: the Punjab, the immigrant community, and anti-immigrant North
Americans, and the Gadar movement.  Some patterns emerge across these four
columns which suggest that links may be hidden beneath them.  

	One such sequence of events may be traced from 1907 through
1913.  In the Punjab context, a series of disturbances over British land
rights legislation erupted in 1907.  The problem had been developing since
1900, when the Alienation of Land Act in India prohibited certain
non-farming castes from owning agricultural lands.  The Act had the
laudatory effect of preventing moneylenders from taking over farmland, but
it irritated many middle-income non-agricultural Punjabis who had aspired
to develop land.  When new canal areas opened in the Punjab, government
legislation prevented the settlers of these newly irrigated areas from
full ownership.  Added to these issues were the problems of nature -
severe famine, and an epidemic of bubonic plague which allegedly took
millions of lives.  The climate of hardship and government oppression
resulted in a series of riots in the district towns of Punjab in the
summer of 1907.

	Shifting to the immigrant context, we find that the years 1907 and
1908 were those of the largest number of immigrants to Canada and the
United States.  The immigrants did not all come from the areas of riots,
and I have no hard evidence to indicate a direct relationship between the
events in the Punjab and the immigration patterns.  Nonetheless, the fact
of unrest in the Punjab means that the emigrants, like everyone else,
perceived the times to be in a state of flux, of political and social
change, a signal for individuals to seek new opportunities and greater
security. 
 
	Almost all of the immigrants were from Hoshiaour, Jullundur, and
Ludhiana districts of central Punjab - an area dominated by peasant
proprietors.  The early 1900s was a time of varied mobility for them: many
of them: many had migrated within Punjab to the new canal-irrigated
colonies in southwestern Punjab.  Eventually, in the United States, the
Punjab immigrants also would be working in newly-irrigated farmlands in
the San Joaquin Valley of California, which is geographically much like
that area of the Punjab.  But initially, in 1907 and 1908, the main
destinations of the immigrants were the lumber camps of Oregon, Washington
state, and British Columbia in Canada.  Many of the immigrants had come to
North America via service in the British army.  Most were Sikhs, and by
the middle of 1908 they had begun building their own place of worship, a
Gurdwara, in British Columbia, and establishing an investment company of
their own, the Nanak Trust Co.
 
	On arrival of new immigrants from Punjab were met with hostility
from some of the white residents of Canada and the United States.  In most
cases, the difficulties were in the competition for scarce jobs: the new
immigrants were willing to do demanding for lass pay.  In 1907 there were
anti-Asian riots in British Columbia, in which Punjabis were targeted
along with Chinese and Japanese; the same year, the Punjabis were the
specific cause for riots in the lumber camps in Bellingham,
Washington.  In 1908 and later, the riots had moved south to the state of
Oregon, and in California, the Exclusion Movement against other Asians
also included hostility against the Punjabis.  And in 1908, British
Columbia effectively ended all new Asian immigrations. 
 
	These events in India, Canada and the United States were the
immediate antecedents tot he founding of the Hindustan Association in
British Columbia in 1909, a precursor to the Gadar Movement, which
advocated self-rule in India.  The Association did not directly respond to
the labor problems and the racial prejudice encountered by the new
immigrants, but clearly those economic and social tensions were in the
background and gave fervor to its proclamations.  During the busy years of
1907-1909, with so much traffic from India to North America, the events in
Punjab and the events abroad could not remain separate in the minds of the
immigrants activists.
	In 1910 through 1913, two other sequences of events
appear.  Restrictive legislation and racial disturbances had turned the
focus on Punjabi emigration away from Canada and towards America: 1910 was
the largest year of migration tot he United States (until recent
times).  It was also a year of racial disturbances in both Oregon and
California.  The same year, Tarak Nath Das began agitating for Indian
nationalism in Seattle, Washington, and Har Dayal did the same in
California after his arrival in February 1911.  Another group, calling
itself the Hindustan Association, this one also a nationalist
organization, was founded in Oregon in 1912.

	By 1912, the immigrant community of Sikhs in California was
sufficiently established to begin building its own Gurdwara, in
Stockton.  The Punjabis (and other Asians) were also sufficiently
established as landowners in the rich developing San Joaquin Valley
farmland to threaten the resident American landowners.  In 1913, an Alien
Land Law was passed, which limited land ownership for most Asians to
three-year issues.  1913 was also a critical year for the Gadar
movement: in May, the Hindi Association was formed in Oregon by Har Dayal,
Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna, and others.  In October, Har Dayal had
established the Yuguntar Ashram as a political headquarters of the
movement in San Francisco; and in November, 1913, the newspaper Ghadr
began publications. 

	One of the most violent actions against the new Punjabi immigrants
occurred in 1914, in Wheatland, California, where European and immigrant
Asian laborers went on strike in the hop fields.  The Asians, especially
the Punjabis, received the brunt of the attacks from strikebreakers and
anti-labor gangs.  According to Professor Bruce LaBrack, members of the
Punjabi immigrant community remember that event even today, and claim that
it had much to do with the raising of their political
consciousness.  These feelings of outrage were transferred to hatred
against the British, for they felt they if they controlled their own
country, this sort of abuse would not have happened.  The date of the riot
is significant: in the same year, 1914, the Gadar party had its greatest
expansion, and garnered widespread financial organizational support from
the immigrant community.

	The juxtaposition of events, of course, does not prove that there
is a causative relationship.  The political and demographic events in the
Punjab may or may not have been the formative cause for the
migrations; the life histories of many immigrants would have to be
surveyed for that assertion to be proven.  Moreover, one cannot prove that
the legislation and racial riots had a direct effect on the developments
of the Gadar party, although there are some evidences of a
correlation.  According to G.B. Lal, an early member of the Ghadar
movement interviewed by Professor Emily Brown, it was the task of the
radical nationalist intellectuals, such as Kartar Singh Sarabha and Har
Dayal, to make that link, and re-direct the interests of the immigrant
community:
We told him [the immigrant farmers] that it was no use to talk about the
Asiatic Exclusion Act, immigration, and citizenship.  They had to strike
at the British because they were responsible for the way Indians were
being treated in America.  There was some response.  They made
donations.  They wanted to know what they could do.  So we suggested that
they start a newspaper and that they call it Ghadr.

	The sequence of events, while not conclusive, are tantalizing.  In
addition to the correlations we have mentioned above, later in Gadar's
development there are even more correlative events: restrictive
immigration laws and the German liaisons of World War I are coincident
with such incidents as the Komagata Maru affair, and the abortive Gadar
uprising of 1915.  In the 1920s, the Third Case in 1923 (in which an
Indian immigrant attempted to escape restrictive clauses by arguing that
Indians are Caucasian) and the infamous "Asiatic Exclusion Act of
1924" occur at the same time as the Gadar party's renewal and expansion
into an international network.

	Although the sequential pattern of these events - in the Punjab,
in the immigrant community, in the American response, and in the Gadar
activity - is only suggestive, it does indicate that the experiences of
the immigrant community in America were linked with Gadar events.  The
Gadar movement was undoubtedly genuine in expressing nationalist support
for a free India; but at the same time it offered something more: a locus
of identity for an angry and confused immigrant community. 

<B>The Gadar Identity</B>

	The identity that Gadar provided was a compound of several
elements, one of the most basic of which was economic.  In the early days
of the formation of the movement, from 1907 to 1912, when embryonic
organizational meetings of the movement was held in British Columbia,
Washington state, and Oregon, most of the immigrants were laborers in the
lumber camps.  There were issues of economic exploitation and class
differentiation were prevalent.  Sohan Singh Bkahna, a key figure in the
early pre-Gadar party meetings in Astoria, Oregon, who later returned to
the Punjab to be a leader of the new communist party there, recalls that
his socialist concerns had their origins in those early labor problems
among the immigrant Punjabi lumber workers in Oregon.  It is clear that
the Oregon meetings in 1912 and 1913 were concerned as much as labor
issues as with nationalism.  

	When the center of Gadar activity shifted to California, however,
the matter became more complicated.  The movement which crystallized in
San Francisco in 1913 was a mixture of intellectuals, political refugees,
and farmers.  The farmers were of several economic classes: some owned
land (which they technically were supposed to abandon after American
government legislation in 1913), others leased land, and others were
landless laborers.  There is no indication that there was any tension
among these different kinds of Indian participants in the movement; and
there was no strong indication, in California, of the class identities and
labor concerns that characterized the Oregon immigrant community.

	Nonetheless, even in California the ingredients existed for class
consciousness; and for some Gadarites that later blossomed into socialist
ideology.  The Gadar ideology before 1918 was almost exclusively
nationalist, with a touch of utopian socialism brought tot he movement by
visionary ideas of Har Dayal.  His idiosyncratic vision, however,  made
very little impress upon the rest of the followers of the movement.  After
the Russian revolution, experienced first-hand by some of the Gadarites
returning to India between 1916 and 1919, Gadar ideology turned decisively
to the left.  In the 1920s, one wing of the old Gadar party was actively
involved in international communism, and helped to formulate the communist
party in the Punjab.

	The Marxism of some of the later Gadarites is a mark of the
apparent secularity of the movement.  Yet if one looks closely at the
character of the immigrant community supporting Gadar, one finds a
strikingly religious strand.  On the movement's publications one finds the
names "Ram, Allah and Nanak" on the masthead, an invitation of membership
to all those who revere those three divine names.  And the movement did,
in fact, include members of the differing faiths: Har Dayal and Ram
Chandra were both Hindus: Bhagwan Singh and Kartar Singh Sarabha,
Sikhs; and Barkatullah, Muslim.  

	Yet the overwhelming numbers of supporters of the movement were
Sikh, and their militant religious history also became a part of the Gadar
identity.  Among the immigrant farmers who supplied money and labor, Sikhs
predominated, and provided the movement's mass base.  After Har Dayal had
left the United States for Europe in 1915, and Ram Chandra was shot during
the 1918 San Francisco trial, the Sikhs under the leadership of Bhagwan
Singh had the movement almost to themselves. 
 
	Sikh institutions and organizations also played an important role
in the movement.  The first Indian nationalist organization in British
Columbia was closely related tot he Khalsa Diwan Society of the Sikh
Gurdwara there, and the later Gadar movement had a symbiotic relationship
tot he Khalsa Diwan Society and the Sikh Gurdwara in Stockton - sometimes
mutually supportive, sometimes competitive.  After 1920, the wing of the
movement in the San Joaquin Valley of California was, for all practical
purposes, a Sikh organization.  There was even some Sikhs who regarded
members of the Gadar movement as Sant Sapahis, warriors in faith. 
 
	This identification of Gadar with Sikhs does not mean, however,
that the movement was ever overtly religious; the movement's ideology was
always political, untainted with the language of faith.  Yet, like much
else in India, the religious and the social aspects were frequently
intertwined, and neither element is without some trace of the
other.  Perhaps, then, it would be better to describe Gadar's religious
character as a communal identity for many of the Sikhs who supported the
movement and found in it the fulfillment of some of their cultural and
social needs.  Again, there was an American echo to a situation of stress
in India: in Punjab, during the first decades of this century, the Sikh
community was going through a period of self-definition, in response to
the communalism of urban Hindus and Muslims.  Within the Gadar movement in
America, that awareness of identity was fused with an immigrant
community's own attempt to define and understand itself in a strange land. 

Gadar as Ethnic Identity

	Gadar was the expression of an immigrant community, and beneath
its intense nationalism there is the awkward self-image of a group of
people who were no longer in India, but not quite yet within North
America.  The syndrome was beginning to emerge: a native nationalism that
they felt when they were within the boundaries of other countries, in part
because of the strangeness of their new surroundings, and in part because
of the inability of the new country to accept them.  These were some of
the dynamics in the nationalism of Gandhi in South Africa a few years
before, and they became part of the motivation of those who founded Gadar.

	One may view the Gadar nationalism as a form of escape, or as an
escape, or as an attempt at accommodation.  In the hostile environment of
North American prejudice, the Indian nationalism gave the immigrant
community the illusion that they were a part of India, and therefore free
from the racial problems of North America.  At the same time, Gadar's
nationalism provided the immigrant community with an ethnic identity, a
sense of pride, which enabled them to stand up to the difficulties of
their hostile North American environment.

	Both views are apt, but initially it was the former interpretation
- nationalism as a link between the immigrant community and its homeland -
that characterized the founding spirit.  By remaining nationalistically
Indian through the Gadar movement, the founders distanced themselves from
the pejorative image of being part of a minority community in a foreign
society.  By keeping their Indian identities, they also kept alive the
possibility that they might return to India.  But as the immigrant
community became more settled, and the Gadar movement became more
integrated with the life of the community, the Gadar nationalism became
fused with their identity as ethnic Indian-Americans.  This appears to be
the case especially after 1920.  In the early 1920s, when the movement
fragmented, one section of the Gadar movement became a platform for local
politics and immigrant community organization.

	There were hints of this role even earlier.  The movement had
helped to identify and train leaders and had given them a basis of
support.  Having had a certain concentration of money and influence, Gadar
became an arena of power within the immigrant community.  In 1915 through
1917, when it was torn apart by two rival factions, the issue was as much
a struggle for dominance as it was a difference of ideology.  The shocking
death of Ram Chandra, and the succession of Gyani Bhagwan Singh tot he
mantle of Gadar leadership in 1918 was a dramatic indication of the
importance attached to the internal power of the party.

	The movement continued as a source of ethnic identity and
nationalist pride through the 1930s and formally came to a demise only at
the time of India's independence.  In the later years it was more and more
an element of the immigrant community identity.  When a U.S. citizen of
Punjabi descent ran for the American House of Representatives in the
1950s, his tenuous link with the Gadar party became a serious campaign
issue, since Gadar had become linked with international communism.  During
the McCarthy era of the 1950s, the entire Punjabi immigrant community in
California feared the revenge of a paranoid America against them.  Only
recently has academic research into the immigrant community and Gadar been
possible again, now that the red scare of the 1950s has subsided.  Once
again, the movement can only be discussed by the community, and has again
become a symbol of its nationalist pride.  

	That symbol has recently taken shape in the form of a
building.  In 1975, the government of India constructed a handsome redwood
library and meeting hall at 5 Wood Street, San Francisco, on the site of
the original headquarters of the Gadar party.  Most of the funds to
construct the Ghadar Memorial Library came from Punjabis living in
California.  In addition to serving as a museum and library, the building
is used as a meeting hall for the local community.  Thus, the name of the
Gadar continues to be identified with the ethnic pride of the children and
grandchildren of the original Gadar rebels.

<B>The Gadar Syndrome</B>

	In brief, then, the "Gadar syndrome" may be described as
follows: A militant nationalist movement is created abroad by expatriates,
for whom the movement is also an outlet for their economic and social
frustrations, and a vehicle for their ethnic identities.  It is the fusion
and the mutual interaction of ethnic anger and nationalist pride.

	Viewed as a general type, a syndrome, Gadar does not stand
alone.  There were other ethnic communities in the United States for whom
ethnicity and nationalist pride came together in a revolutionary
movement.  The immigrant Irish laborers, for example, were waging their
own struggle against the British at the time of Gadar movement, and the
members of the Irish community in California became Gadar's close
allies.  The Gadar party, in turn, printed tracts in favor of Irish
independence.  After the death of Ram Chandra, members of the Irish
independence movement befriended the family and supported other members of
the movement.

	Among other Asian communities one finds further instances of the
Gadar syndrome.  The 1911 revolution led by Sun Yat Sen occurred during a
time when the Chinese immigrants in the United States were the subjects of
social prejudice and restrictive legislation, similar to that experienced
by the Punjabi immigrants, and the active support of the Sun Yat Sen
revolution by immigrant Chinese was not altogether unlike the
revolutionary activities of the Gadarites.  In 1910, Sun Yat Sen came to
America to organize chapters of his revolutionary organization, the
Tongmenghui, which in alliance with local organizations "emerged as a
significant political force in Chinese communities in the U.S. and
Canada."  Korean nationalist activities in the United States also
paralleled those of the Gadar syndrome.  

	Thus, even though the Gadar movement may hold a peculiar place in
the history of India's struggle for independence, it is not an isolated
incident in the pattern of ethnic communities in the United
States.  Viewed from the perspective of India, the Gadar revolutionaries'
earnest but unsuccessful contribution tot he task of independence is
something of an enigma.  But viewed from the perspective of the North
America, the activities of the Gadar rebels appear quite different.  In
the American context, the movement is, in part, the expression of an
oppressed minority community.  The anger and humiliation was reversed into
pride - a nationalist pride - which sharpened into the militant potency of
Gadar, and its futile revolution.
