<P>That several Hindu residents of San Francisco and the Pacific Coast were among 
  the three hundred East Indians who have been hanged in British India after being 
  accused of sedition, was announced here yesterday by Ram Chandra, editor of 
  the local HINDUSTAN GADAR, which has been described by the British secretary 
  for India as the most dangerous of all revolutionary publications. Chandra has 
  received the photographs of five of the most prominent of the California Hindus 
  who went to India during the war, and who have been executed. They are: Karta 
  Singh, Hindu aviator, who has been hanged, according to the report of British 
  Crown Prosecutor Patnam. Karta Singh was on the staff of the Hindustan Gadar 
  of San Francisco. He made bombs and explosives, organized political riots and 
  helped to carry these out. He was an active revolutionary, and designed a flag 
  for his fellow conspirators, Independent India, which was to symbolize an India 
  free from British rule. <BR>
  <BR>
  Kanshi Ram, contractor of Oregon. According to Crown Prosecutor Patnam, he plotted 
  the removal of several police officers in Frozepore. He gave $11,000 to the 
  Hindustan Gadar of San Francisco, and tock $1,000 to India with him to finance 
  the revolution. The money was confiscated and Kanshi Ram hanged.<BR>
  <BR>
  Nidhan Singh, who lived for twenty years in the United States and who was regarded 
  as an influential leader, was also hanged. He successfully introduced arms and 
  ammunition into India after the outbreak of the war and plotted several outbreaks 
  and risings. He organized and took part in looting the British treasury at Moga 
  Punjaub. Another Hindu of considerable standing in the eyes of his countrymen, 
  Sohan Singh, religious leader of the 'Namdhari' sect, was also hanged. Ram Chandra 
  says this man was arrested on mere suspicion, being considered the chief supporter 
  of the Hindustan Gadar. Prethle Singh was another who went to death.<BR>
  <BR>
  Ram Chandra states that 700 Hindus have been transported for life, and over 
  10,000 were interned in India without trial….. <BR>
