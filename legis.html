<p><h3><a name="immigration"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Immigration</a> Legislation</FONT></h3></p>
<b>The Immigration Act of 1917 dictated that Indian laborers were no longer able to
 enter the United States; their native country existed in the "barred zone" identified in the Act.  And the Immigration 
Law of 1924 prevented recent immigrants from retrieving family members from their native country.  Thus, wives and
 children were unable to join their husbands and fathers.  One other law discriminated against Asian Indians.
<p><h3><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The California <a name="alien"> Alien</a> Land Law</FONT> </h3>
The California Alien Land Law of 1913, revised in 1920, prevented immigrants from owning and leasing their own land, making it a difficult struggle for those who made their living as farmers.  A second indication of the discrimination which existed toward Asian Indians appeared in the Stephens report.</b>
<br>
<p><h3><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The<a name="thind">Thind</a>Case</FONT></h3>
<b>In 1923, the verdict of United States v. <a href="t_usphot.html#thind">Bhagat Singh Thind</a><a href="http://www.multiracial.com/government/thind.html">(U.S. vs Thind 261 US 204(1923))</a> became a major
 setback for Asian Indians struggling to survive and exist in a new land.  Justice Sutherland decided that East  Indian  immigrants, referred to as Hindus, were "aliens ineligible to citizenship."  They were designated as Caucasian, but this did not mean that they were "white."  Citizenship was only allowed for whites and persons of African descent; thus, Asian Indians were not  allowed citizenship in the country.  The

										<p class="MsoNormal">In the annals of 
										Asians’ struggle for US citizenship, 
										Bhagat Singh Thind’s fight for 
										citizenship occupies a prominent 
										historical place. Thind’s citizenship 
										was rescinded four days after it was 
										granted. Eleven months later, he 
										received his citizenship for the second 
										time. However, the Immigration and 
										Naturalization Service appealed to the 
										Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which 
										sent Thind’s case to the next higher 
										court for ruling. Thind valiantly fought 
										his case in the Supreme Court but the 
										judge revoked his citizenship simply due 
										to the color of his skin. The verdict in 
										Bhagat Singh’s case, United States v. 
										Thind ensured that the rights and 
										privileges of naturalization were 
										reserved for “Whites” only.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">
										<img title="Image" style="FLOAT: left" height="280" alt="Image" hspace="6" src="9-bhagat%203.jpg" width="200" border="0">Indians 
										in the United States were commonly 
										called “Hindoos” (“Hindus”) irrespective 
										of their faith. Thind’s nationality was 
										also referred to as &quot;Hindoo” or “Hindu&quot; 
										in all legal documents and the media 
										although he was a Sikh by faith and 
										preserved his religious beliefs and 
										practices by keeping his beard, long 
										hair on his head and wore turban.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Bhagat Singh came 
										to the US in 1913 to pursue higher 
										education in an American university. 
										However, on July 22, 1918, he was 
										recruited by the US Army to fight in 
										World War 1. A few months later, on 
										November 8, 1918, Bhagat Singh, a turban 
										wearing “Hindu”, was promoted to the 
										rank of an Acting Sergeant. He had not 
										even served for a month in his new 
										position when the war was declared 
										ended. He received an “honorable 
										discharge” on 16th of December, 1918, 
										with his character designated as 
										&quot;excellent&quot;. [Rashmi Sharma Singh: 
										Petition for citizenship filed on 
										September 27, 1935, State of New York].</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">The U.S. 
										citizenship conferred many rights and 
										privileges but only “free white men” 
										were eligible to apply. In the United 
										States, many anthropologists used 
										Caucasian as a general term for &quot;white.” 
										Indian nationals from the north of the 
										Indian Sub-Continent were also 
										considered Caucasian. Thus, several 
										Indians were granted US citizenship in 
										different states. Thind also applied for 
										citizenship from the state of Washington 
										in July 1918. </p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">He received his 
										citizenship certificate on December 9, 
										1918 wearing military uniform as he was 
										still serving in the US army. However, 
										the Immigration and Naturalization 
										Service did not agree with the district 
										court granting the citizenship. Thind’s 
										citizenship was revoked in four days, on 
										December 13, 1918, on the grounds that 
										he was not a “free white man.” Thind was 
										trusted by the US to be a soldier in the 
										army and had all the rights and 
										privileges like any “white man.” He was 
										worthy of trust to defend the US but his 
										color stood in his way for the US to 
										trust him for citizenship.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Thind was 
										disheartened but was not ready to give 
										up. He applied for citizenship again 
										from the neighboring state, Oregon on 
										May 6, 1919. The same Immigration and 
										Naturalization Service official who got 
										Thind’s citizenship revoked first time, 
										tried to convince the judge to refuse 
										citizenship to a “Hindoo” from India. He 
										even brought up the issue of Thind’s 
										involvement in the Gadar Movement, 
										members of which campaigned actively for 
										the independence of India from the 
										British Empire. Judge Wolverton, 
										believing Thind, observed, “He (Thind) 
										stoutly denies that he was in any way 
										connected with the alleged propaganda of 
										the Gadar Press to violate the 
										neutrality laws of this country, or that 
										he was in sympathy with such a course. 
										He frankly admits, nevertheless, that he 
										is an advocate of the principle of India 
										for the Indians, and would like to see 
										India rid of British rule, but not that 
										he favors an armed revolution for the 
										accomplishment of this purpose.” The 
										judge took all arguments and Thind’s 
										military record into consideration and 
										declined to agree with the INS. Thus, 
										Thind received US citizenship for the 
										second time on November 18, 1920.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">The Immigration and 
										Naturalization Service had included 
										Thind’s involvement in the Gadar 
										Movement as one of the reasons for the 
										denial of citizenship to him. Gadar 
										which literally means revolt or mutiny, 
										was the name of the magazine of 
										Hindustan Association of the Pacific 
										Coast. The magazine became so popular 
										among Indians, that the association 
										itself became known as the Gadar party.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">The Hindustan 
										Association of the Pacific Coast was 
										formed in 1913 with the objective of 
										freeing India from the British rule. The 
										majority of the supporters and members 
										were from the Punjabi community who had 
										come to the US for better economic 
										opportunities. They were unhappy with 
										racial prejudice and discrimination 
										against them. Indian students, who were 
										welcomed in the universities, also faced 
										discrimination in finding jobs 
										commensurate with their qualifications, 
										on graduation. They attributed 
										prejudice, inequity and unfairness to 
										their being nationals of a subjugated 
										country. Har Dyal, a faculty member at 
										Stanford University, who had 
										relinquished his scholarship and studies 
										at Oxford University, England, provided 
										leadership for the newly formed 
										association and channelized the 
										pro-Indian, anti-British sentiment of 
										the students for independence of India.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Soon after the 
										formation of the Gadar party, World War 
										I broke out in August, 1914. The 
										Germans, who fought against England in 
										the war, offered the Indian Nationalists 
										(Gadarites) financial aid for arms and 
										ammunition to enable Indian volunteer 
										fighters to expel the British from India 
										while the British Indian troops would be 
										busy fighting war at the front. The 
										Gadarite volunteers, however, did not 
										succeed in their mission and were taken 
										captives upon reaching India. Several 
										Gadarites were imprisoned, many for 
										life, and some were hanged. In the 
										United States too, many Gadarites and 
										Germans who supported Gadar activities, 
										were prosecuted in the San Francisco 
										Hindu German Conspiracy Trial (1917-18) 
										and some were convicted for varying 
										terms of imprisonment for violating the 
										American Neutrality Laws.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Thind like many 
										other Indian students had joined the 
										Gadar movement and actively advocated 
										independence of India from the British 
										Empire. Judge Wolverton granted him 
										citizenship after he was convinced that 
										Thind was not involved in any 
										“subversive” activities. The Immigration 
										and Naturalization Service appealed 
										against the judge’s decision to the next 
										higher court – the Ninth Circuit Court 
										of Appeals which sent the case to the US 
										Supreme Court for ruling on the 
										following two questions:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Is a high caste Hindu of full 
											Indian blood, born at Amrit Sar, 
											Punjab, India, a white person within 
											the meaning of section 2169, Revised 
											Statutes?&quot; </li>
											<li>Does the act of February 5, 1917 
											(39 Stat. L. 875, section 3) 
											disqualify from naturalization as 
											citizens those Hindus, now barred by 
											that act, who had lawfully entered 
											the United States prior to the 
											passage of said act?&quot;</li>
										</ol>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Section 2169, 
										Revised Statutes, provides that the 
										provisions of the Naturalization Act 
										“shall apply to aliens, being free white 
										persons, and to aliens of African 
										nativity and to persons of African 
										descent.”</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">In preparing briefs 
										for the Ninth Circuit Court, Thind’s 
										attorney argued that the Immigration Act 
										of 1917 barred new immigrants from India 
										but did not deny citizenship to Indians 
										who were legally admitted like Thind, 
										prior to the passage of the new law. The 
										purpose of the Immigration Act was 
										“prospective and not retroactive.”</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">
										<img title="Image" style="FLOAT: right" height="450" alt="Image" hspace="6" src="9-bhagatthind.jpg" width="283" border="0">Thind’s 
										attorney gave references of previous 
										court cases of some Indians who were 
										granted citizenship by the lower federal 
										courts which considered Indians as 
										Caucasians and hence eligible for 
										citizenship. (U.S. v. Dolla 1910, U.S. 
										v. Balsara 1910, Akhay Kumar Mozumdar 
										1913, Mohan Singh, 1919). In 1922, in 
										the case of a Japanese immigrant, US vs. 
										Ozawa, the highest court, the U.S. 
										Supreme Court officially equated “white 
										person” with “a person of the Caucasian 
										race”. Judge Wolverton, in granting 
										citizenship to Thind, said, “The word 
										“white” ethnologically speaking was 
										intended to be applied in its popular 
										sense to denote at least the members of 
										the white or Caucasian race of people.”</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Thind was convinced 
										that based on Ozawa's straightforward 
										ruling of racial specification and many 
										similar previous court cases, he would 
										win in the fight and his winning will 
										open the doors for all Indians in the 
										United States to obtain US citizenship. 
										Little did he know that the color of his 
										skin would become the grounds for denial 
										of the right of citizenship by the 
										highest court in the US.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Justice George 
										Sutherland of the United States Supreme 
										Court delivered the unanimous opinion of 
										the court on February 19, 1923, in which 
										he argued that since the &quot;common man's&quot; 
										definition of “white” did not correspond 
										to &quot;Caucasian&quot;, which Indians were, they 
										could not be naturalized. Thus the 
										Judge, giving his verdict, said, “a 
										negative answer must be given to the 
										first question, which disposes of the 
										case and renders an answer to the second 
										question unnecessary, and it will be so 
										certified.”</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Shockingly, Justice 
										Sutherland, the same judge who had 
										equated Whites as Caucasians in US vs. 
										Ozawa, pronounced that Thind though 
										Caucasian, was not “White” and thus was 
										ineligible for US citizenship. The judge 
										apparently decided the case under the 
										prevailing pressure by the forces of 
										prejudice, racial hatred and bigotry, 
										not on the basis of precedent that he 
										had established in a previous case. </p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The Supreme Court 
										verdict shook the faith and trust of 
										many Indians in the American system of 
										justice. The economic impact for land 
										and property owning Indians was 
										devastating as they again came under the 
										jurisdiction of the California Alien 
										Land Law of 1913 which restricted 
										ownership of land by persons ineligible 
										for citizenship. Some Indians had to 
										liquidate their land holdings at 
										dramatically lower prices. America, the 
										dreamland, did not offer the dream they 
										had come to realize.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Thind's citizenship 
										was revoked and the INS issued a 
										certificate in 1926 canceling his 
										citizenship for a second time. The 
										Immigration and Naturalization Bureau 
										also initiated proceedings to rescind 
										American citizenship of Indians and from 
										1923 to 1926, citizenship of fifty 
										Indians was revoked. The Barred Zone Act 
										of 1917 had already prevented fresh 
										immigration of Indians. The continued 
										shadow of insecurity and instability 
										compelled some to go back to India to 
										anchor their lives with their families 
										and familiar environment. The Supreme 
										Court decision further lead to the 
										decline in the number of Indians to 3130 
										by 1930. [From India to America; Garry 
										Hess, p 31]</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">There probably was 
										little sympathy for treating “Hindu 
										Thind” shabbily but there was a concern 
										for the poor treatment of “US Veteran 
										Thind.” Thus in 1935, the 74th congress 
										passed a law allowing citizenship to US 
										Veterans of World War I, even those from 
										the 'barred zones'. Dr. Thind finally 
										received his U.S. citizenship through 
										the state of New York in 1936, taking 
										oath for the third time to become an 
										American citizen. This time, no official 
										of the INS dared to object or appeal 
										against his naturalization.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Thind had come to 
										the US for higher education and to 
										“fulfill his destiny as a spiritual 
										teacher.” Long before his arrival in the 
										US or of any other religious teacher or 
										yogi from India, American intellectuals 
										had shown keen interest in Indian 
										religious philosophy. Hindu sacred books 
										translated by the English missionaries 
										had made their way to America and were 
										the “favorite text” of many members of 
										the Transcendentalists’ society which 
										was started by some American thinkers 
										and intellectuals who were dissatisfied 
										with spiritual inadequacy of the 
										Unitarian Church. The society flourished 
										during the period of 1836-1860 in the 
										Boston area and had some prominent and 
										influential members including author and 
										philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson 
										(1803-1882), poet Walter Whitman (1819 – 
										1892), and writer Henry David Thoreau 
										(1817-62).</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Emerson’s writings 
										reflected influence of Indian 
										philosophy. In 1868, Walt Whitman wrote 
										the poem &quot;Passage to India.&quot; Henry David 
										Thoreau had considerable acquaintance of 
										Indian philosophical works.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Bhagat Singh Thind 
										had started delivering lectures in 
										Indian philosophy and metaphysics.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Thind, during his 
										early life, was influenced by the 
										spiritual teachings of his father whose 
										“living example left an indelible 
										blueprint in him.” During his formative 
										years in India, he read the literary 
										writings of American authors Emerson, 
										Whitman, and Thoreau and they too had 
										deeply impressed him. After graduating 
										from Khalsa College, Amritsar, Punjab, 
										and encouraged by his father, he left 
										for Manila, Philippines where he stayed 
										for a year. He resumed his journey to 
										his destination and reached Seattle, 
										Washington, on July 4, 1913.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Thind had gained 
										some understanding of the American mind 
										by interacting with students and 
										teachers at the university and with 
										common people by working in lumber mills 
										of Oregon and Washington during summer 
										vacations to support himself while at UC 
										Berkeley. Thus, his teaching included 
										the philosophy of many religions and in 
										particular that contained in Sikh 
										scriptures. During his lectures, 
										discourses and classes to Christian 
										audience, he frequently quoted Vedas, 
										Guru Nanak, Kabir, etc. He also made 
										references to the works of Ralph Waldo 
										Emerson, Walt Whitman, and Henry David 
										Thoreau to which his American audience 
										could easily relate to. He gave new 
										“vista of awareness” to his students 
										throughout the United States and was 
										able to initiate “thousands of 
										disciples” into his expanded view of 
										reality – “the Inner Life, and the 
										discovery of the power of the Holy Nãm.” 
										He never converted or persuaded any of 
										his students to become Hindu or Sikh but 
										generously shared India’s mystical, 
										spiritual and philosophical treasures 
										with them.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Thind who had 
										earned a Ph.D, became a prolific writer 
										and was respected as “spiritual guide.” 
										He published many pamphlets and books 
										and reached “an audience of at least 
										five million.” The list of his books 
										include Radiant Road to Reality, Science 
										of Union with God , The Pearl of 
										Greatest Price, House of Happiness, 
										Jesus, The Christ: In the Light of 
										Spiritual Science (Vol. I, II, III), The 
										Enlightened Life, Tested Universal 
										Science of Individual Meditation in Sikh 
										Religion, Divine Wisdom in three 
										volumes. [www.Bhagatsinghthind.com]</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Thind was working 
										on some books when suddenly he died on 
										September 15, 1967. He was born on 
										October 3, 1892, thousands of miles away 
										in the village of Taragarh, tehsil 
										Jandiala, district Amritsar, in the 
										state of Punjab, India. He was survived 
										by his wife, Vivian, whom he had married 
										in March, 1940, daughter, Rosalind and 
										son, David, to whom several of his books 
										are dedicated.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Thind never 
										established a temple, Gurdwara or a 
										center for his followers but lived for a 
										long time in the hearts of his numerous 
										followers. David Thind, long after his 
										father’s death, has established a 
										website www.Bhagatsinghthind.com to 
										propagate the philosophy for which Dr. 
										Bhagat Singh Thind spent his entire life 
										in the US. He has also posthumously 
										published two of his father’s books, 
										Troubled Mind in a Torturing World and 
										their Conquest, and Winners and Whiners 
										in this Whirling World and is working on 
										some others.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal">Thind extended the 
										boundaries of his fight by challenging 
										the forces of race and color. 
										Unfortunately, even the highest US court 
										could not rise above the low level of 
										skin color.</p>
