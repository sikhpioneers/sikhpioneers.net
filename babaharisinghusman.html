  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While 
    the nation was celebrating the Independence Day on 15th August, 1969, yet 
    another, perhaps the oldest-living veteran freedom-fighter was breathing his 
    last, almost unknown, unlamented and unsung, like so many of his comrades-in-arms. 
    His long life was a saga of struggles and sacrifices. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After serving 
    in the British Indian Army for a short spell, Baba Hari Singh, then a young 
    man of 27, along with thousands of Indians went to the U.S.A. in 1907 to earn 
    his livelihood. Being a sturdy peasant, he could have earned a lot there, 
    through sheer hard labor, but instead, found the atmosphere choking, because 
    the slave Indian coolies were an object of contempt and ridicule in a free 
    society. This aroused feelings of patriotism and national pride in him and 
    he plunged heart and soul in the Ghadar Party Movement launched by Lala Hardyal, 
    Baba Sohan Singh and other revolutionaries. In 1914, taking advantage of the 
    weakness of the British power, caused by their involvement in a global war 
    with Germany, the Ghadar Party was planning an armed uprising in India. Baba 
    Hari Singh was entrusted with the delicate but dangerous task of accompanying 
    a shipload of arms and ammunition, procured with German assistance, to centers 
    of rebellion in India. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the British 
    Naval Intelligence got scent of the adventure, and after hot pursuit forced 
    Babaji and his compatriots to consign the ill-fated cargo to the sea and take 
    refuge in Jawa (Indonesia) after the assassination of his comrades on the 
    ship. Babaji, somehow escaped their fate. He retired deep into the Jungle 
    and mountainous territory of Jawa and with the active assistance of an Indian 
    settler, he assumed the name and acquired the passport of a pathan servant, 
    Usman Khan, who had recently died. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates of his 
    return to India having been sealed, under Govt. directions to shoot at sight, 
    he was obliged to settle down in Indonesia, till opportune time. There, he 
    married a local beauty of Sandanish race and Muslim faith, and again with 
    the co-operation of the German Bonsul to Indonesia, got jobs in Tea, Rubber 
    and Coffee plantations. The years that followed made substantial additions 
    to his fortune and family. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the patriotic 
    fever still kept burning in deep recesses of his soul. The Second World War 
    provided Indians another opportunity to break the shackles of slavery. He 
    readily offered his services to the Japanese, who were then giving tough time 
    to the British. In liaison with their secret service, he started working among 
    the Indian forces in South East Asia to arouse their patriotic feelings against 
    the British Imperialism. &quot;He played a very significant role in the foundation 
    of the Indian Independence league and the Indian National Army and became 
    Secretary in the Overseas Recruiting Department in the League Headquarters, 
    which role brought him in close contact with Netaji Subash Chandra Bose.&quot; 
    Here, on the South Eastern Front, his elder son Mr. Hira Singh Handry, who 
    was born and brought up in Indonesia, laid down his life, fighting for the 
    freedom of his 'Fatherland.'<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend and admirer 
    of the Japanese for their valor and valuable assistance, Baba Usman openly 
    criticized them for their imperialistic designs towards India and alleged 
    rape of Indian womanhood at the hands of their soldiers in the occupied territories 
    of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. For this outspokenness, he had to pay dearly 
    with insults and injuries. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1945, as a 
    result of the atom bomb attacks, Japan was compelled to lie low and surrender. 
    The British being victors, most of the Indian patriots, fighting against them, 
    were forced to flee for their lives and limbs. Baba Hari Singh Usman, therefore, 
    went back to Indonesia, but his restless spirit gave him no peace. The Indonesian 
    struggle for Independence was in full swing and his sympathies were naturally, 
    with the native population. This earned him the wrath of the ruling Dutch. 
    On the charge of helping the rebels, he was captured, mercilessly beaten and 
    put behind the bars along with other Indonesian patriots. On anther occasion, 
    a group of religious fanatics nearly cut his like short. But he was yet to 
    live another quarter-century to see and taste the fruit of freedom!<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help 
    of some Indian merchant friends in Jakarta, he secured his release from the 
    prison, and in October, 1948, set foot on the soil of free India, after an 
    absence of 41 years, to spend the rest of his days in his ancestral village, 
    Baddowal, near Ludhiana. One of his daughters and her husband, who are Indonesian 
    citizens, helped their aged parent build a small beautiful house, outside 
    the village, in the lap of nature, near the High School, where he took keen 
    interest in the welfare of the students. There, in seclusion, he expired on 
    the Independence Day, 1969, after a brief illness. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May last, I 
    called on him to hear at first-hand his thrilling experiences and to know 
    his opinions about men and matters. The interview lasted two days. He struck 
    me as a wonderful man, very agile, erect and alert for his ninety years. Behind 
    his pathan like unsophisticated exterior, he seemed to possess a gracious 
    and hospitable heart and a keen zest for life. He narrated dozens of anecdotes 
    from his childhood onwards with relish, but sometimes with biting satire. 
    One thing, he said, he shunned most, was hypocrisy - be in religious, social 
    or political spheres. He appeared to me to be a deeply religious man, having 
    firm faith in God, but without formalism. &quot;Death&quot;, he declared &quot;is 
    not at all awesome for me. I have seen it face to face at least five times 
    in my life. Let it come, when it pleases, for I am now enjoying overtime.&quot; 
    And there was a twinkle in his eyes. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few of 
    his close friends know that thought without a formal higher education, he 
    was a man of letters in his own right. In 1914, after Kartar Singh Sarabha 
    left U.S.A. for home, Baba Hari Singh took up the editorship of the Punjabi 
    section of the party organ 'The Hindustan Ghadar' for sometime. A few of his 
    poems were then published under pen-name 'Faqir'. His poetic narration of 
    the events of the Second World War in 757 stanzas of 4-lines each running 
    into 127 closely written pages, is the only writing of its kind in Punjabi. 
    Besides, he wrote five Qissas and about 50 short poems on varied topics in 
    Punjabi and Urdu, making the best use of is well-earned rest. In Urdu prose, 
    he wrote some essays concerning the youth, the character and the country. 
    Also in Urdu, he feelingly narrated some incidents form the book of his life 
    in diary-style. All these works were written, under pen-name 'Gumnam' - the 
    unknown - and still remain unpublished. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Displayed on the 
    walls of his living room, till his last day were two cloth banners - one in 
    English and Punjabi with the inscription:<br>

    Hindu Na Musalman<br>
    The other banner read in Hindi and Punjabi:<br>
    &quot;Subash Chander Zinda Hain To Ham<br>
    Zinda Hain.<br>
    Ham Zinda Hain To Subash Chander<br>
    Zinda Hain.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the labors 
    of a life-time, the grateful nation granted him a pension of Rupees Twenty-five 
    per month, which he needs no more. <br>
