<P>Most of the photos displayed here illustrate mainly Sikh immigration owing to the fact that early settlement from Punjab was predominantly Sikh.  In the early part of this century all immigrants from India were indiscriminately called "hindoo" or "hindu" regardless of religious affiliation.  The term "hindoo" was also sometimes used in a pejorative sense for anyone from that continent.

</td><td><a name="thind"><a href="immigrat.html#thind">Bhagat Singh Thind</a>, a native of Punjab entered the United States in 1912.  Thind was attending college and working in a lumber mill when he was inducted into the US army.  He was honorably discharged from the army on 16th December 1918.  In 1920 Thind applied for citizenship which was granted to him in Oregon by the district court.  A naturalization examiner objected to the court's decision and sought for Thind's citizenship cancellation on the grounds that Thind was not white.  An appeal was taken to the "Ninth circuit court of appeals" and the U.S. Supreme Court decided against granting Naturalization to Thind on February 10th 1923.  It was a landmark decision in United States Vs Bhagat Singh Thind.</td></tr>

Although most of the outward signs of faith were practiced among only the most religious of the early Sikh immigrants, like their fellow Muslims they were strict about death rituals.  When a Sikh died, a funeral photograph was taken of the deceased wearing a turban, whether or not he had worn one in the United States.  The photo was then sent home to assure family members of the man's orthodoxy.
