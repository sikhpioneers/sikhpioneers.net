<p>The Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubillee was to be celebrated in 1897. The government of India sent Sikh Lancers and Infantry Regiment to London to attend the jubilee. After the celebration these stalwart Sikh soldiers were to return home by way of Canada . </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>After crossing the Atlantic by ship, they traveled from Montreal to Vancouver by train. On the way they saw fertile land, great rivers and lakes, open skies, the mountains, forests and wild life. They had left their small pieces of lands to the big landlords or the absentee money lenders. They were land-hungry-sons of Panjab. Hunting wild animals was one of their hobbies. They thought of settling in Canada to fulfill their dreams. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>On the way back they told their dreams of the new world to their compatriots, posted at Shinghai, Hongkong and Shanghai . </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are unconfirmed reports that some of the soldiers deserted from their regiments and stayed behind in Vancouver . Another unconfirmed figure is given that there were about 100 Sikh soldiers in Vancouver around 1900. But there are pictures available in our records to show that there were a good number retired Sikh soldiers in and around Vancouver in 1904. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Arjan Singh Chand was elected president of The Khalsa Diwan Society in 1951. He met the Sikh pioneers and kept a hand written very informative diary in which he has given the facts and figures including dates of the historical events. He has even mentioned the names of the pioneers from whom he had a particular information. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>According to his diary the following <strong>Punjabis </strong> landed in Vancouver in the beginning of 1904: </p>
<p>SANTA SINGH Village Gude </p>
<p>BHAGAT SINGH Village Gude </p>
<p>MELA SINGH Village Gude </p>
<p>SANDHI TELI Village Gude </p>
<p>INDAR SINGH Village Sur Singh </p>
<p>JAWALA SINGH Village Kharaudi </p>
<p>MAULA Village Halwara </p>
<p>British Columbian polititions, missionaries, labour leaders and the local press did not want Asian labour in Canada but industrialists were short of labour and went on advertising through steam ship companies for cheap labour from Punjab and East Asian colonies of British empire . </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>According to Gary Hess the author of “The Hindu in America ”, there were 303 Hindus in Canada in 1905. He writes: </p>
<p>“Most of them were farmers and labourers from Punjab where Canadian companies seeking contract labour had publicized the economic opportunies in America .” </p>
<p>The first immigrants to come were the Sikh Lancers and Infantry Regiment soldiers and their friends from the British colonies, Hongkong, Canton and Shanghai . Second type of immigrants were those who read the ads of the steamship companies inviting labourers to Canada . Third type of people were patriots who were forced by hunger and poverty to join the British Indian Army but at heart they were deadly against the foreign rulers. They wanted to get rid of their hunger, poverty and slavery. One by one they left the British Indian Army and wanted a refuge far away from their slaved motherland but they did not know that what kind of slavery they have to face in Canada . </p>
<p>During 1906, thousands of Sikhs landed in Canada . Among these arrival 98% were Sikhs and two percent Hindus and Muslims. </p>
<p>Most of the Sikh soldiers were employed in lumber hills, around Vancouver and Victoria but some of them went as far as Kootney. The White labourers were against Sikh labourers but mill owners received them with open arms because they found out that Sikh soldiers were very hard working people and could produce double than Chinese and Japanese. Some of them were working between Victoria and Port Alberny on railway tracks. </p>
<p>Wherever they were, they had to face problem of accommodation. Although the owners of the mills provided them wooden huts and bunks to sleep on, they crowded like sheep and cattle in their barns. During winter it was very cold. Drinking water was provided but for washing and bathing they depended on rivulets. There were no proper toilets. </p>
<p>All of them, they, had their common kitchen and cooked turn by turn. After working hours they had no place to go. Some of them had brought their Indian music instruments –Dholki (drum), Sarangi and Dhad (musical instruments). They sang together, they worked together, they cooked together and they ate together. </p>
<p>Then they though of having their own places for worship. They built their temporary temples on the lands of their mills with the permission of mill owners. They had their religious assembly on Sundays and holidays. </p>
<p>During the second half of the 19 th century thousands of Sikhs were taken to East Asian British colonies, to assist the British authorities. Whereever they were posted they built their temples for worship. Although they were considered rulers. They were very badly needed by the British to keep the control over the natives of those colonies. </p>
<p>When they came to Canada , the condition was totally different. There were only two types of people living in Canada : Canadian Natives and White immigrants for Europe . Natives were almost imprisoned in their settlements. They had no say in the government. </p>
<p>Canada was under the domination of British. Although the immigrants were from all European countries but rulers were the British. For such a vast land, the population was not more than five millions. The government of Canada and the public of Canada belonged to the same White race. The Sikh soldier had nobody to oppress the way that they had to do in East Asian countries. Therefore they were not welcomed by the people as well as by the government. They were only wanted by the mill owners because they were short of labourers. </p>
<p>When the politicians, missionaries, union leaders and the controllers of local press wanted to get rid of Sikh labourers, they made up their mind to stay and not to be pushed around. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>They had their temporary places for worship in Vancouver and Victoria. In one of the meetings they formed a committee to built a Sikh temple in Vancouver . The following persons were given the authority to collect funds, supervise and construct the Sikh temple at 2 nd Avenue : </p>
<p>BHAI ARJAN SINGH Village Malik ( Ludhiana ) </p>
<p>BHAI WARYAM SINGH Village Nathoke (Ferozepur) </p>
<p>BHAI BHAG SINGH Village Bhikhiwind ( Lahore ) </p>
<p>BHAI BALWANT SINGH Village Khurdpur ( Jullundur ) </p>
<p>BHAI BHOLA SINGH LAMMA Village Boora Gujjar (Ferozepur) </p>
<p>BHAI BHOLA SINGH Village Cheema ( Ludhiana ) </p>
<p>BHAI SEWA SINGH Village Gude ( Lahore ) </p>
<p>The foundation stone of the building was laid in the last week of October 1907 and inauguration took place on 19 th of January, 1908. </p>
<p>The following community leaders were elected unanimously on the executive committee of Khalsa Diwan Society, Vancouver: </p>
<p>BHAI SEWA SINGH President </p>
<p>BHAI BHAG SINGH General Secretary and Treasurer </p>
<p>BHAI BHOLA SINGH Second Secretary and Treasurer </p>
<p>BHAI BISHAN SINGH Member </p>
<p>BHAI BHOLA SINGH Member </p>
<p>By unanimous vote Bhai Balwant Singh was elected the first priest (Granthi) of the Sikh Temple , Vancouver . </p>
<p>Sikhs had to face every day a new problem. One of their friend died in 1907. They wanted to cremate him but there was not any cremation ground. The mayor of Vancouver would not allow any cremation within the limit of the city. Christian missionaries were forcing the idea of burial but at the same time they would not allow a Hindu dead body to be buried in a White man's grave yard. </p>
<p>Sikhs had to wait for overnight. They took the dead body at the middle of the night to a distant forest and cremated the body in the morning. At that time some of their White friends were also present to sympathise with them. </p>
<p>Khalsa Diwal Society was in existence but they did not have their own worship place yet. They decided that they must have their own building for the Sikh temple and a crematorium. </p>
