<FONT color="#990000">"Caucasian immigrants socially assimilate into the host community

usually within a generation.  Their communities are relatively large and

non-visible i.e., not identifiable at sight.  Their chief survival

interest is in maintaining a link with the parent country's language and

culture which, in general, is not difficult if the parent country is a

free nation.  The immigrants, and their children after them, can continue

to define their cultural identity simply by reference to the "homeland."

In some cases, the national origin may also define a church affiliation.

In these cases, the religious and the ethic identities reinforce each

other improving the chances of survival.



South Asian and other non-white immigrants, the "visible" minorities, fall

into two groups.  Some assiduously seek assimilation and eventually

acquire the culture, habits and even the prejudices of the host community

giving up their native language, dress, and diet as well as the observance

of religious customs. Most of those who were non-christians at the time of

their immigration do not adopt Christianity as their new religion and

essentially become non-religious.  However, because the host community

continues to regard all persons of one skin color as a single distinct

minority group, this group finds social assimilation to be elusive.



Other South-Asians are willing to accommodate, adjust and adapt in respect

of dress, diet and language and even acculturize but retain their links to

the parent country and religion and attempt to pass these on to the next

generation through the establishment of ethnic and religious subsystems.

Many ethnic subsystems take the form of population concentrations.



STRESSES FACED BY SIKHS IN AMERICA



  a. Interaction with the Host Community



Stress for a member of the minority community arises primarily from

feeling of being treated as an outsider by the majority community.  On

occasions the majority has acted deliberately to exclude the immigrant and

even the following generations from the mainstream.  Active hostility

against "Asians" and "Hindus" forced the early Sikh immigrants into

low-paying jobs confining them, with some notable exceptions, to the

lowest economic groups in society.  They were not allowed to bring their

spouses from Punjab and if they married an American citizen, she would

lose her citizenship by such marriage.  They had been declared ineligible

to acquire citizenship and land laws provided that aliens ineligible for

citizenship could not buy, own, or lease agricultural land.  Many married

catholic Mexican women and their children grew up as catholics. Social

interaction with the host community was limited by language.  As far as

the host society was concerned the only distinction they retained was the

involuntary one of skin color they shared with all South-Asians.  The host

society treated them as members of this larger minority.



Later, highly educated immigrants too had to face difficulties in finding

employment, accommodations, professional advancement and education of

their children in spite of the existence of anti-discrimination laws and

absence of restrictions on acquiring property.  A common question at job

interviews has been: "Are you prepared to adopt the American dress?"  The

real question is: "Are you willing to cut your hair?"  Sikh employees who

became citizens are asked by their supervisors and colleagues if they plan

to cut their hair.



Discouraged in their quest for suitable employment in their fields of

specialization or having had unpleasant experience on the job with respect

to advancement and recognition, many highly qualified Sikh engineers and

scientists have found alternative careers in owner-operated businesses.

There are cases of Sikhs with Master's degrees unable to find any

employment primarily because of the reluctance of the employers in hiring

"different looking guys."



In looking for housing, this writer was once told by a landlady: "We do not

rent apartments to people with whiskers."  In 1978 an American Sikh

citizen, accompanying his wife at her naturalization was ordered [4] by

the U.S. District Judge to remove his turban or leave the court.

In 1982 an American Sikh was told [5] by his employer to comply with a new

safety policy that directed men to be clean-shaven.  In 1984, a Deputy

Registrar in Ohio refused [6] to renew the driving license because the

American Sikh would not agree to have his picture taken without his turban.

As recently as 1990, a Sikh child in Ohio was told that he could not play

basketball in his middle school because of a rule forbidding headgear

during play.  There have been numerous such incidents.



Dress codes for employees, membership of an association, laws requiring

helmets and other safety headgear, etc. have contributed to create stressful

situations for Sikhs.  The immigrant or the convert Sikh understands the

situation and may either succumb and cut his hair or insist on his right to

practice his faith and fight, sometimes successfully, to get the rules

changed.  However, Sikh children do not understand why people won't let

them be Sikhs and find such confrontations extremely troublesome.



The first group consists of those who gave up their religious beliefs

altogether and essentially merge into the larger minority of South-Asian

immigrants.  This merger involves losing their identity as a Sikh.  The

second group consists of those who succumb to pressures of obtaining a

livelihood or advancement at work and pass the blame on to the host

society as being intolerant.  The third group do not believe "Amrit"

ceremony (formal initiation as a Sikh by taking "Khande da Pahul") is

necessary and dispute the necessity of keeping hair.  They insist that

the distinguishing Sikh symbols (the five k's) are anachronistic and that

the faith does not require them.



The religious services in various Gurdwaras do not follow any uniform

pattern. Over the last several years, yet another intra-community stress

has been due to the situation in Punjab, the Sikh homeland.  Sikhs are

alarmed at the Indian Government's persecution of members of their faith.

They are concerned about the rampant human rights violations.



  c. Sikh Children



Sikh children are involuntary victims of stress.  They are place in a

situation which is not of their making and which they often are unable to

comprehend.  The feeling of isolation, rejection and helplessness can play

havoc with their self-esteem and personal well-being.



      i.  Interaction with host society

	  

 A young Sikh child finds it extremely disconcerting that his peers at

school find him strange and are unfriendly.  Being stared at while walking

down the street is awkward enough for anyone but specially so for a little

child or an adolescent.  Older children will often pull at the Sikh

child's hair or play with it.  Sikh boys are often asked: "What is that on

your head?"  This stressful situation often makes the Sikh child withdrawn,

uncommunicative, and worried.  Teachers not used to having identifiable

minority students in their classes have on occasions interpreted this as

evidence of a learning disability, further aggravating the problem.  Some

teachers advise Sikh parents to use English at home to accelerate the

process of acculturization even though there is ample evidence that

bilingual students are better learners.  In fact, children of immigrant

parents are known to be able to switch accent when talking to their

parents or grandparents.  Changing schools and "getting to know" a new set

of peers all over again is a very trying experience for Sikh children.

Young Sikh males find it extremely troublesome to be often the only

students in their schools with a turban.  They have to face official

indifference to their concerns, social isolation and often hostility.

They are not allowed to participate in certain sports.  The teachers are

not sympathetic to a religious belief different from their own.  Even when 

they excel academically, the "different" children are discouraged from

representing their school or class.  Many children as well as teachers

have been known to refer to the lone Sikh child as "that Indian boy

(girl)."



       ii. Stresses at home

	   

 For many children the most stressful situation is their elders' adherence

to a "foreign" culture.  Brought up in America, they do not have an

understanding or appreciation of the culture their parents grew up with

and are attached to.  They are culturally American, because of the school

education and the interaction with their peers, but are racially Asian.

The host society insists on regarding them as foreigners.  They feel that

they belong neither to America nor to their parents' country of origin.

They can identify with neither and feel isolated and rejected.  Unable to

escape their racial identity, many children would like to reinforce it

with knowledge of their heritage and pride in their ancestry.  However,

the information they get about their religion is often contradictory.

They wish to be able to proudly say where their parents or ancestors came

from but there is no Sikh country anywhere in the world.



Their "homeland" Punjab is part of India.  It is difficult for them to

identify with India as a whole and most Americans would not know where

Punjab is.  Many understand Punjabi when it is spoken at home and some have

learnt to read it.  Few know it well enough to read from

Siri Guru Granth Sahib.  Growing Sikh children are quite confused over the

difficulty of finding marriage partners in the endogamous option preferred

by their parents and of preserving their faith in an exogamous one

for which greater choices might be available."
