<p><b><i>THE SUTTER COUNTY FARMER</i></b>,  FRIDAY, JUNE 29, 1923
<p>
<b><i>Hindu and White Woman Marry</i></b><p>
<i>Couple From Sutter County, Denied License, Wed at Sea Beyond Three Mile Limit</i><p>
If Hindus are anxious to marry white women in this country, and County Clerks have refused them licenses as

number of instances where such marriages have occurred.  According to reports, [indecipherable]
this county and in one case there is a family of children.
<p>
Last week a marriage took place at sea outside of the three-mile limit near San Francisco, this method being resorted to after a marriage license had been refused.  The groom was Sander Din, aged 31, and the bride, Berilla M. Nutter, aged 32 both of Sutter County. Din is engaged in the rice business and his bride was a cook on the place.  Learning that they could not get a license here they went to Martinez where the County Clerk of Contra Costa county upon the advice of the District Attorney, also refused them the necessary documents.  The Hindu took his prospective bride to San Francisco where he hired a launch with Captain Luis Alberta as captain and when the boat reached the three-mile limit the captain performed the marriage ceremony and the party returned.  Whether this kind of a marriage is legal is not altogether clear but it is not probable that any contest will be made.
