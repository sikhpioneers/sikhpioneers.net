						<font class="story_text2">A brief history of early 
						immigration to the United States reveals prejudice, 
						hostility and blatant discrimination against the people 
						of Asia. At the turn of the twentieth century, when 
						Indians started coming to the United States, Americans 
						had already developed hatred and hostility against the 
						Chinese and Japanese. In 1907, the number of Indians in 
						the Pacific Coast states was very small, but they became 
						victims of the prevalent anti-Asian sentiment of the 
						American people. There were barely 250 Indians in the 
						city of Bellingham in the state of Washington, yet 
						American lumber mill workers committed unforgivable 
						atrocities and expelled all the Hindus from the city in 
						what is known as Bellingham Hindu Race Riots. </font>

						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">On the 100th anniversary 
							of the Hindu Race Riots, the Indian American 
							community remembers the pioneers who patiently 
							suffered physically, psychologically and 
							economically but stayed calm under provocation, 
							remained law abiding under lawlessness and observed 
							non-violence under threat of violence, practicing 
							what Gandhi Ji was preaching in South Africa at that 
							time. </font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2"></font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">Chinese were the first 
							among Asians to come to the United States in search 
							of economic opportunities. The lure of gold in the 
							1850s induced them to migrate and by 1880, the 
							number of Chinese in the United States had reached 
							322,000, almost all in the Pacific Coast states. The 
							rapid growth of Chinese population provoked 
							resentment against the immigration of “cheap” labor. 
							The employers welcomed the Asian laborers and 
							employed them in their lumber mills, railroad 
							construction and farms while the white laborers 
							vehemently opposed them. The labor unions agitated 
							bitterly against the employment of Chinese workers 
							and wanted to bar their immigration to the United 
							States. Some politicians, perpetually starved for 
							campaign money and union endorsement, willingly and 
							openly backed the union demand. In 1862, Congress 
							passed a law forbidding American vessels to 
							transport Chinese immigrants to the United States. 
							The Naturalization Act of 1870 denied Asians the 
							right to become naturalized citizens. The unions 
							kept pressuring members of the Congress for more 
							stringent laws. In 1882, America passed the Chinese 
							Exclusion Act which virtually ended the source of 
							cheap labor for American business. </font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2"></font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">Following the passage of 
							the Chinese exclusionary law, labor organizations 
							launched a virulent campaign of intimidation against 
							those who employed Chinese servants or workers. The 
							American press continued to give the ‘Yellow Peril’ 
							a high profile by depicting the Chinese as depraved 
							opium smoking, alien looking, diseased coolies.” 
							Anti-Chinese sentiment in the Northwest region 
							sometimes exploded into violence at various places, 
							forcing some Chinese workers in the fields, mines, 
							fisheries, lumberyards and laundries to flee the 
							area. </font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2"></font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">However, the labor need of 
							the American employers for their businesses did not 
							end with the enactment of the new law. They 
							encouraged Japanese workers to migrate to bridge a 
							labor supply gap. Japanese laborers had been coming 
							to Hawaii but in 1900, their labor contracts became 
							invalid on Hawaii becoming part of the United 
							States. So, many Japanese workers also started 
							migrating to the Pacific Coast states in the 
							mainland. Thus, the number of Japanese workers 
							rapidly increased to meet labor shortage. But the 
							labor unions found them a new threat to white 
							workers, blaming the Japanese for lowering wages of 
							American laborers and branding them as the new 
							‘Yellow Peril’. In 1905, with the formation of 
							Asiatic Exclusion League, the anti-Japanese movement 
							was launched. But the movement had little immediate 
							impact on the number of immigrants from Japan, as 
							close to 31,000 Japanese laborers, largest ever in a 
							single year, came to America in 1907 . However, 
							under constant and relentless pressure by the 
							Asiatic Exclusion League, President Roosevelt, in 
							1907, signed the Gentlemen's Agreement with Japan 
							ending immigration of Japanese laborers to the 
							United States and issued an executive order stopping 
							the secondary migration of Japanese from Hawaii to 
							the mainland. </font></div>

						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">The first trickle of 
							Indians in search of economic opportunities came to 
							California at the end of the nineteenth century. On 
							April 5, 1899, four Punjabis who had worked in the 
							British Royal Artillery in Hong Kong, landed in San 
							Francisco and were allowed to stay in the United 
							States by the US Immigration Service . The grant of 
							permission gave an encouraging signal for other to 
							Indians to follow those four pioneers. </font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2"></font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">There was abundance of 
							jobs in the lumber industry in Washington and Oregon 
							states and plenty of land to farm throughout the 
							Sacramento, San Joaquin and Imperial valleys of 
							California. On hearing about the economic 
							opportunities in America, many more Punjabis headed 
							towards the far away land. The new immigrants found 
							jobs which the white workers would not do, usually 
							menial jobs, in factories, lumber mills, farms, etc. 
							They were needy workers who accepted low wages, poor 
							working conditions and very often traveled from 
							place to place in search of work. The employers 
							preferred Indians to the whites for their 
							willingness to do any and all kinds of work. The 
							labor unions despised the Hindu laborers for fear of 
							competition for jobs and wages. As the number of 
							Indian workers increased within a span of few years, 
							they too started facing discrimination and 
							hostility, in the same manner as the other Asians 
							who had come before. </font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2"></font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">Indian immigrants in 
							Canada had been facing similar problems as those in 
							the United States. Since India and Canada were 
							British dominions, it was easier for the Indians to 
							migrate to Canada where they had started coming at 
							the beginning of the twentieth century. The majority 
							of the new immigrants were Punjabi veterans or 
							peasants who were physically well built, strong and 
							muscular. They were eager to obtain work and found 
							jobs in lumber mills in British Columbia. They were 
							hard working and proved more productive than the 
							white workers. Some Canadian companies sought more 
							of similar laborers and publicized availability of 
							job opportunities in Canada to entice more cheap 
							labor from India. For the first few years, about 
							2000 immigrants were permitted to come to Canada 
							annually. </font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2"></font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">As per the 1904 Census, 
							there were only 258 Indian nationals in British 
							Columbia but that number increased rapidly during 
							the two-year period of 1906-1907 when about 5000 
							Indians migrated to Canada, thereby causing unease 
							for the local whites. There was already a backlash 
							against the Chinese and Japanese from the white 
							laborers and their unions. Fear of labor competition 
							from the newcomers, led to racial antagonism and 
							demands for exclusionary laws against Indian 
							workers. The Asian Expulsion League in British 
							Columbia actively lobbied against the importation of 
							cheap labor from India. </font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2"></font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">The local press carried 
							many scare stories against the &quot;Hindu Invasion.&quot; In 
							1908, the Canadian government required Indian 
							immigrants to have $200 in their possession on 
							landing. Also, the Indian immigrants were denied 
							entry if they had not come by &quot;continuous journey&quot; 
							from India. Since there was no direct shipping 
							between Indian and Canadian ports, legal immigration 
							of Indians to Canada virtually ended. As the Indian 
							immigrants saw the doors closing on them in Canada, 
							many started filtering to the United States where 
							they found jobs in the lumber mills in Bellingham 
							and other towns in the state of Washington which 
							borders the state of British Columbia in Canada.

							<font class="story_text2"></font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">The Indians in the United 
							States and Canada were commonly called &quot;Hindoos&quot;, 
							(&quot;Hindus&quot;) irrespective of their faith. The 
							overwhelming majority of the arrivals from India 
							were Sikhs who preserved their religious beliefs and 
							practices by keeping beard, long hair on their head 
							and wore turban. They were easily distinguishable 
							from the rest of the immigrants, but unfortunately, 
							they were called &quot;Rag heads&quot;, a derogatory term used 
							for the &quot;Hindus&quot; at that time. </font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">

						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">In the United States, 
							Indians legally admitted from 1899-1907, numbered 
							only 1967 . The total number of Indians in the 
							country, however, was slightly larger as some 
							Indians had come directly from Canada, Hong Kong and 
							other countries. However, Hindu concentration in a 
							few small communities in the Pacific Coast states, 
							particularly several with turbans, drew high level 
							of visibility on their presence and provoked 
							hostility from the Asiatic Exclusion League which 
							carried propaganda against the &quot;The Tide of Turbans&quot; 
							and &quot;Hindu Invasion of America&quot;. </font></div>

							<font class="story_text2">In the early 1890s, three 
							railroad lines connected the small cities which 
							became Bellingham on November 4, 1903, thus enabling 
							area businessmen to market their products, salmon, 
							timber and coal to the outside world. After the 1906 
							San Francisco earthquake, lumber was needed for 
							rebuilding of San Francisco. In time, lumber and 
							shingle mills sprang up in the area to meet the 
							surge in demand. These industries were labor 
							intensive and needed cheap manual labor which was 
							filled by the new arrivals – the Hindu workers.

						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">Bellingham had a history 
							of strained race relations. In the 1880s the Chinese 
							had been driven from the town by a mob. A few years 
							later, the Japanese faced similar hostility. Labor 
							unions and their members had resorted to lawlessness 
							and violation as a means of achieving their 
							objectives. A similar situation could prompt mob 
							action in violent persecution of the Asian workers.

						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">Hindu workers had come as 
							sojourners and without spouses, were paid low wages 
							and could afford to live only in the poor squalid 
							part of the town or in shanty structures provided by 
							the mill owners. They lived frugally, subsisted on 
							income that was prohibitive for whites to survive 
							on, maintained low standard of living and many 
							shared crowded lodging to save money to pay off 
							their debt or meet family obligations back home. 
							They were willing to do any kind of manual job but 
							the unskilled white laboring men feared that 
							competition from Hindu workers would displace them 
							from their jobs and bring wages down. Their 
							festering hostility and pent-up frustrations 
							manifested in violence against Hindus, vandalism of 
							Hindu belongings and hatred of their religion, 
							lifestyle and living. </font></div>

						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">At the time of the riot, 
							Bellingham’s lumber mills employed about 250 
							unskilled Indian contract workers. Punjabi laborers 
							accepted jobs which white laborers had refused to 
							do. They would perform work which could be in 
							violation of labor laws but would not complain for 
							fear of employer retaliation. The union leaders 
							wanted to maintain higher wage levels for their 
							members but had failed to convince the mill owners 
							to fire the Indian workers and discontinue their 
							hiring. One mill owner in particular, Whatcom Falls 
							Mill Company provoked resentment at the rumored 
							replacement of white laid-off workers with Indians. 
							The racial prejudice and bitterness, born out of job 
							loss of white laborers, erupted into violence 
							against Indians who had the least social or 
							political power in the city of Bellingham or even in 
							the country. </font></div>

							<font class="story_text2">The American Federation of 
							Labor (AFL) had more than 800 members in Bellingham 
							and was an affiliate of the Asiatic Exclusion 
							League. On Labor Day, September 2nd, 1907, more than 
							a thousand union members and others paraded through 
							the town to demonstrate their unity and show their 
							strength. There was a beating of several Hindus 
							which nearly resulted in a general disturbance. The 
							union warned the mill owners that no Indians should 
							be employed in the lumber mills or anywhere in 
							Bellingham after Labor Day. </font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2"></font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">The Indian workers 
							nonetheless appeared at their jobs on the following 
							day, Tuesday, September 3. At night, at least five 
							instances of violence to Hindus were reported to 
							police, and a gang of boys and young men smashed 
							windows of two of the Hindu homes. In the afternoon, 
							on September 4, 1907, two Hindus walking on C Street 
							were chased and beaten. In the evening, a mob of 
							400-500 white men, predominantly members of the 
							Asian Exclusion League, attacked Hindu dwellings, 
							smashed windows and pulled the Indians from their 
							beds. Panicked, some Hindus escaped from their 
							quarters in night clothes while others jumped out of 
							the buildings, some hurting themselves in the 
							process. The rioting mob rushed to C Street to the 
							biggest domicile where thirty Hindus were lodged. 
							The crashing of window panes and the loud 
							humiliating yells of the rioters for the Hindus to 
							come out, apprised neighbors that a riot was in 
							progress. Then, the rioters went on a rampage from 
							mill to mill, finding as many Indian workers as they 
							could while others ransacked the homes of the 
							Hindus, and pocketed money, jewelry, bank passbooks 
							and other valuables. They eventually rounded up 
							about two hundred Indian workers, brandishing clubs 
							triumphantly, herded them to the City Hall basement

							<font class="story_text2">Indians became victims of

							nightmares of fright, brutality and vindictiveness 
							forced traumatized Indian workers to leave 
							Bellingham in search of safe haven. An area 
							newspaper reported, &quot;Frightened Hindus numbering 
							135, or approximately half the Indian colony, left 
							Bellingham on September 5, one day after the riots. 
							Twenty-five of the dusky Singhs had left at noon and 
							seventy in the evening by Great Northern for 
							Vancouver and approximately forty left by the 4 
							O'clock train for Northern California&quot;. Although 
							Hindu crews were assured of protection by special 
							police officers at the mills of the B. B. L. 
							Company, the E. K. Wood Lumber Company and the 
							Morrison Mill Company, but those who got paid at the 
							mills, cashed their checks at the banks and headed 
							to the train station. However, some mill owners took 
							advantage of the situation and refused to pay the 
							Hindu workers. Several stayed nervously for one 
							extra day in deadly fear of their lives to draw 
							their pay and get their checks cashed. Within a few 
							days, all Hindus left the unfriendly city, 
							denunciating the lack of police protection. Many of 
							the departing Hindus expressed their disappointment 
							for they had heard of America as a good place for 
							laboring men, yet they were paid no better wages and 
							became victims of violence and lawlessness in the 
							presence of law enforcement officials. </font></div>

						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">The town police failed to 
							provide any protection to the Indian immigrants from 
							the angry mob. As reported by the Bellingham Herald 
							of September 5, mobs controlled the city without 
							interference from authorities. When the terror 
							stricken Hindus were in the basement of City Hall, 
							police made no effort to stop mob outrages. The 
							public at the time believed that a &quot;little nerve on 
							the part of officers would have checked the riot.&quot;

							<font class="story_text2">Mayor Alfred L. Black 
							called a special meeting of the city council on 
							September 5, and stated that Hindus were British 
							subjects and had every right to be in the city and 
							engage in such occupations as they desired. The 
							mayor assured the Hindu interpreters, Nand Singh, 
							Attar Singh and Sergent Singh, who were present at 
							the council meeting, that they were entitled to 
							protection of the laws of the country, state and 
							city. The mayor directed the police chief &quot;to swear 
							in fifty deputies to prevent any further rioting or 
							the breach of the laws.&quot; The mayor also instructed 
							the chief to arrest and prosecute any and all 
							persons to a final determination any man engaged in

							<font class="story_text2">Despite assurances from

							south of Bellingham, to work in the sawmills there. 
							Two months later, on November 5th, 1907, over five 
							hundred armed men attacked and beat the Indians, 
							robbed them and destroyed their belongings. The

							<font class="story_text2">The Asiatic Exclusion

							<font class="story_text2">Indians were British 
							subjects but the British Indian ambassador did not 
							care to ask the American government for compensation 
							for injuries or loss of property of the Indian 
							workers. Since the media reported about the riots 
							worldwide, the British Consul in Seattle visited 
							Bellingham. He did not care to meet or sympathize 
							with the Indian nationals who suffered at the worst 
							racial attack against them in America, but he met 
							instead with the mill owners to obtain a list of 
							names of Hindu workers for his official report to 
							his government. The number of Hindus employed by 
							various mills was given as 145 as per Gerald N. 
							Hallberg in his article on Bellingham, Washington’s 
							Anti-Hindu Riot. However, on Thursday, September 5, 
							2007 the Bellingham Herald reported the number as 
							186 under the heading &quot;Hindus March Back to Mills 
							under Guard&quot;. The actual number of Hindus forced out 
							from the city was substantially more. </font></div>

							<font class="story_text2"></font></div>
						<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 20px">
							<font class="story_text2">Union leaders, churches 
							and the media denounced the riots. The Bellingham 
							Herald in its editorial titled 'A Public Disgrace' 
							condemned the action of the rioters. &quot;No amount of 
							argument will justify the acts of the mobs. 
							Exhibition of man's inhumanity to man as that of 
							last night shall not be tolerated. Such lawlessness 
							is an outrage upon American decency. The Hindus were 
							there in response to a demand created by the 
							scarcity of labor. In filing the jobs, the Hindus 
							were contributing to the prosperity of the 
							community. A mob of hoodlums has disgraced the

							<font class="story_text2">Rev. J.W. Fiesher of the

							hired here not from choice but rather from 
							necessity. And this not because there are not white 
							laboring men but because there is a large class of 
							white laborers so irresponsible that they cannot be 
							depended upon. The outbreak of riots was to say the 
							least unpatriotic, un-American, cowardly and 
							uncharitable.&quot; Rev. William Orr Wark, pastor of the 
							First Congregational Church criticized the Police 
							Chief Thomas saying, &quot;The police lacked moral 
							courage and that a man acting as Chief Thomas did is 
							not fit to be the head of the police department.&quot;

							<font class="story_text2">Despite widespread

							League and the labor unions used violence and riots, 
							presumably as an effective method of excluding the 
							Hindu workers from jobs and residential communities. 
							They also kept incessant pressure on elected 
							officials and politicians who, in 1917, succeeded in 
							getting an immigration law passed by the United 
							States Congress over the veto of President Woodrow

							people full of meanness, malice and ill-will against 
							different looking people. Indians did not attempt to 
							take away jobs from the unskilled white workers; 
							they simply filled a portion of the deficit in human 
							resources. The white laborers, excited by the labor 
							unions, perpetrated unparalleled, heinous crimes 
							against innocent and law abiding Hindus who had come 
							from a distant land with a dream of a better life,

I was talking yesterday with Jane Singh, and it got me to thinking 
that you, too, might be interested in the updates to our webpage on 
investigation case files.
As you may recall, we have been putting on-line the index to NARA San 
Bruno's holdings of investigation case files 1882-1953 at 
http://iber.berkeley.edu/casefiles
The latest round of updates brings the total number of casefiles that 
have been indexed to 90,000--that is, up through the early 1920s.
If you go to the search page on the site and go to the "Birth Place" 
part, there is a pull-down menu.  You can scroll down to "India" , 
change the "Retrieve" to (say) 500 records, then do a search.  You 
should get about 200+ names of people "born in India".
Have fun.
Hope this finds you well.
Cheers,
--Bob
