<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theodore 
  Roosevelt once wrote: &quot;No man is worth his salt who is not ready at all 
  times to risk his body, to risk his well-being, to risk his life in great cause.&quot; 
  And what could be greater than the cause of emancipation of one's motherland 
  from bondages of all sorts - political, social, religious or economic? Baba 
  Sohan Singh, the well-known leader of the Ghadar Party, was indeed true to his 
  salt. He was a prince among patriots, a revolutionary par-excellence, who lived 
  to see the rise, and, by his precept and example, helped to bring the fall of 
  the mighty British Imperialism. In so doing, he spent the best period of his 
  life, 26 years, in some of the worst jails of the country. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the prevalent 
  custom would require, being the first child of his parents, he was born (in 
  January 1870) in his maternal village, Khotre Khurd, not far from his ancestral 
  home, Bhakna, District Amritsar. No record of his exact date of birth is available. 
  His father, Karam Singh Shergill, was a sturdy farmer and an orthodox Sikh, 
  who was ever ready to mitigate the sufferings of others around him. His mother, 
  Ram Kaur, was a quiet woman. But the greatest debt of gratitude that he openly 
  acknowledged, was to his loving step-mother, Har Kaur. For him, she was the 
  mother about whom Fredric Hantz Adams has said:<br>
  <br>
  She was good as goodness is<br>
  Her acts and all her words were kind,<br>
  And high above all memories<br>
  I hold the beauty of her mind.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a married 
  boy at the early age of 15, when he finished his primary education in the village 
  school. Being the only and somewhat spoilt child in his affluent family, and 
  without the protecting influence of his father, he soon fell in bad company 
  (as he himself told me), and would have proved to be a great curse for the family, 
  had Baba Kesar, the Namdari saint, by his living example and psychological treatment, 
  not channelize his thoughts and actions, along constructive direction. This 
  was a real turning point in his life. Young Sohan Singh developed a deeply moral 
  and religious attitude, which, shorn of formalism, remained a part of his very 
  nature till his death. Seeds of self-denial, service to the community and love 
  for the motherland had been sown deep in his soul. By his long association with 
  the Namdhari Sangat, he came to be highly revered. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial difficulties 
  now followed. Farming proved to be too hard for him. Like hundreds of adventure-loving 
  Indians, most of whom were illiterate or semiliterate middle class Panjabi peasants, 
  he left for the United States of America in 1909, in search of employment. There, 
  like others, he enrolled himself as an ordinary laborer in sawmills and other 
  factories. The work was very tough and the environments were not congenial. 
  In the free society of the U.S., Indians were looked down upon and ridiculed 
  with epithets such as 'Hindoo Slaves', 'running dogs of British Imperialism', 
  'thirty crores black sheep'. These insults proved to be a blessing in disguise. 
  Constant contacts with the Indian students and the enlightened exiled patriots 
  like L. Hardyal, Bhai Parmanand, Tarak Nath Dass, who were then in America, 
  inspired the working Indians to organize themselves to fight for their honor 
  and for the freedom of their country. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1913, in Portland, 
  a representative and dynamic organization 'Indian Association of the Pacific 
  Coast', with Headquarters at Yugantar Ashram, came into being with the avowed 
  object of liberating India by means of an armed revolt. Baba Sohan Singh was 
  elected its first President. He showed organizing skill of a high order. To 
  propagate its ideals, a multi-lingual paper 'Ghadar' with L. Hardyal, the General 
  Secretary as its Editor, was started for free distribution among Indians in 
  all countries under the British rule. The 'inflammatory material' of this paper 
  proved to be so popular that the organization itself came to be known as Ghadar 
  Party. Selfless service, supreme sacrifice and anti-British sentiments were 
  the catch-words of the Ghadar Party. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1914, the party 
  expanded its activities and made hurried preparations to collect and send arms, 
  ammunitions and volunteers to India, in order to ferment an armed uprising. 
  &quot;We are quite satisfied that the out-break of war with Germany was regarded 
  as the psychological moment for a revolution in India, in which it was expected 
  Germany would participate&quot;, opined judges trying Ghadar Party leaders, 
  later on. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kamagatamaru affair 
  in Canada added fuel to the fire. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baba Sohan Singh, 
  now President for the second year, was directed by the Party to set sail for 
  India with a consignment of arms. Spreading his message of &quot;do or die&quot; 
  among the Indians in Nagasaki, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Penong, (with the British 
  secret service agents all around) and under assumed names, he reached Calcutta 
  Port, on his way to Panjab to organize the revolt; but was immediately taken 
  into custody along with some other associates. Thus in October, 1914, his direct 
  connection with the activities of the Ghadar Party was suddenly snapped. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How and why this 
  movement later on failed, is a different tale of treachery and tears. One of 
  the reasons is the detention of seasoned leaders like Baba Sohan Singh, before 
  the fuse of revolution could be ignited. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In police custody, 
  every pressure was exerted on him including threats of firing squad, harassment 
  of his mothers and wife and lure of new canal lands, to make him an approver; 
  but he was made of a sterner stuff. Ultimately, in 1915, he was tried in the 
  First Lahore Conspiracy Case. Twenty four persons in this case were awarded 
  capital punishment for waging war against the crown. Their properties were also 
  ordered to be confiscated to the state. Baba Ji was one of them. He did not 
  flinch and refused to petition for mercy. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on a technical 
  flaw in the prosecution story, pointed out by the eminent Jurist, Pandit Moti 
  Lal Nehru that they were arrested from ships and had not set foot on the Indian 
  soil, and on intervention by the nominated members of the Viceroy's Council, 
  the death sentence of 17 of the 24 accused was commuted to life-imprisonment. 
  Providence, thus, saved Baba Sohan Singh from the gallows, but worse fate awaited 
  him in the form of the Andeman Jail, which was, as he stated &quot;a living 
  hell let loose on earth.&quot; Here, scant regard was shown for human dignity. 
  The prisoners were treated worse than animals. Their most elementary demands 
  were haughtily ignored. To protest against such high-handedness on the part 
  of authorities, the fellow-prisoners, led by Baba Ji, went on hunger strike 
  thrice. The Government was ultimately compelled to appoint an Enquiry Commission, 
  and then, in 1920, prohibited the use of this Jail for political prisoners. 
  For other categories of prisoners, serving life-terms, many reforms were introduced. 
  Baba Sohan Singh considered it a unique achievement of the Ghadar Party Leaders. 
  But, for this, seven patriots had to lose their lives. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such hunger strikes 
  and fasts-unto-death did not end with the Andemans. The process continued, in 
  his case, in other jails, for half a dozen times - always against injustice, 
  ill-treatment and tyranny. He firmly believed in perseverance, which, they say, 
  is the master influence of the firmest souls and the discipline of the noblest 
  virtues. That is why, perhaps, he had acquired great self-discipline. This is 
  also evident from the fact that, earlier, under the influence of Baba Kesar, 
  he had given up the use of such an essential commodity as common salt for twelve 
  long years. Then again, while undergoing prison-terms, he renounced the use 
  of sugar for a similar period. Some may find in these acts, traces of fanaticism, 
  but all great men are known for their unflinching faith in self-control, in 
  one form or another. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Andeman, he 
  was transferred to the Coimbatore, Yarvada and Lahore Central Jails, where he 
  spent the remaining years of his prison term. It was in Lahore Central jail 
  that he met S. Bhagat Singh and other revolutionaries, who were highly impressed 
  by his quiet dignity, magnetic personality and a spirit of spontaneous service 
  and sacrifice. After undergoing a sentence of 16 years, he was released in 1930 
  after a prolonged hunger strike. But he was yet to spend a decade behind the 
  bars. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rousing reception 
  and cordial welcome followed. However, his restless spirit did not let him sit 
  idle. Early 1931 saw him plunge into the Civil Disobedience Movement launched 
  by the Congress Party. For this, he had to serve a six-month jail term. But 
  soon, sharp differences with the party bosses on the question of his active 
  participation in the revolutionary activities of the Kisan Sabha, forced him 
  to quit the Congress. Since then he had been the moving spirit behind the Peasants 
  and Workers' Movement of the Country. He was elected President of the All India 
  Kisan Sabha, for the first time, in 1934. This association landed him in jail 
  on a number of occasions. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wedded to the ideals 
  of socialism till the end, he had marked sympathies with communism. But he was 
  never dogmatic in his approach. He emphatically maintained that those who looked 
  upon other countries for leadership, were themselves misled. &quot;We must bring 
  national regeneration, keeping in view our own needs and peculiar circumstances 
  obtaining in the country. Peasantry and the labor force and the backbone of 
  a nation. Any government or any party which is not slave to a handful of persons 
  representing vested interests, but cares for the well-being of the workers and 
  that of the man in the street, is the best for us,&quot; he declared. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The partition of 
  the country in 1947, resulting in loot, arson, abductions and killings gave 
  a rude shock to his sensitive mind. He saw to it that not a single Muslim life 
  was lost in the area under his influence. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, work, constructive 
  work - was real worship. After release, he, along with Baba Jawala Singh, first 
  set up a 'Kirti Kisan Ashram', by donating 17 acres of land to educate and help 
  the destitute children of the deceased patriots. Later on, he donated land and 
  money and started a high school in his village. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last few years 
  of his eventful life he spent in his humble cottage surrounded by green fields. 
  His wife had died earlier and he had no child, but even then, he felt contented. 
  <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the privilege 
  of spending two days with him in May, 1966. He was 96 then. Although bent like 
  an aged lion with uneasy steps and failing eyesight, I found him quite young 
  in spirit. During my long interview with him covering many facets of his busy 
  life, he did not even once show signs of fatigue, irritation or confusion. A 
  born optimist, he told me, &quot;The future of our country and the mankind is 
  safe with the enlightened youth. Let them stop not, till the goal is reached.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 21, 
  1968, full of years (99), wit and wisdom, he breathed his last, after a brief 
  illness. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A public figure, 
  paying glowing tribute to him, aptly said: &quot;Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna was 
  not only a great revolutionary, but a leader of revolutionaries; was not only 
  a great patriot, but the father of patriotism in Punjab; was not only a great 
  hero of the country, but the torch-bearer of the new heroism in Indian nationalism.&quot; 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His whole life exemplifies 
  what Hugh Walpole has said:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tisn't 
  the life that matters!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's 
  the courage you bring to it. </p>
