<p>While contemplating on the history of Indians (from India ) in Las Vegas my thoughts took me a bit away from it. <strong>What about a history of Indians outside of </strong><strong>India </strong><strong>, I wondered </strong>? It has to be understood that the history of Indians is by and large the history of the Hindus. The Muslim and Christian population was nearly zero in India at different points in recent times. </p>
<p>A related question is: <strong>What would have fascinated Indians before independence to leave </strong><strong>India </strong><strong>? </strong> Gandhi's autobiography spells out the general perception of Hindus never going overseas. It prevailed amongst in the present region of Gujarat and Maharashtra . Once the British were entrenched in India after quelling the 1857 Mutiny, they imposed heavy measures on India including McCauley system of education and Indian Penal Code. The oppressive and punitive taxation broke the backbone of Indians. </p>
<p>Whereas, the late 19 th century was a golden period in the British Empire ruling over half the world, it was the darkest period for Indians. The African slavery abolished in UK (1834) and USA (1864), the British devised a new concept of slave labor from India . It was called indentured labor. <strong>Essentially Indians were kept slaves for a period of five years and then set free. </strong> The British badly needed man power for various plantations and mines in their large colonies over 60 in number and spread in every continent. </p>
<p>Under this scheme Indians from many parts were sent to nearly all the British colonies. The sturdy Punjabi and Sikhs in particular were shipped to the cold Canadian regions of Alberta and Vancouver for new agro industries. <strong>Ironically, in African colonies, men from Tamilnad and Kerala were brought. </strong> In Latin American and Pacific Island colonies, men and women from eastern UP and Bihar were sent. The present states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra seem to have supplied scant indentured labor. </p>
<p>I don't have the exact records at hand, but close to half a million people may have left India under this scheme. To the best of my knowledge not even a single Christian went as an indentured labor from India . A few Muslims from Gujarat sent to Africa received preferential treatment from the British. </p>
<p>It must be pointed out that the indentured labor came from the princely states of India . <strong>The Indian officers of the princely rulers used coercion, deceit and lies to round up their own people </strong>. The British were seldom at the scene! It was the same approach that worked in Africa for slave trading except for the fact that the Hindus were not chained in the ships sailing to the colonies. </p>
<p>I always wondered at the absence of people from Bengal , Orissa and Southern Bihar . Well, an explanation came in due course. <strong>People of this region were physically emaciated due to systematic starvation caused by decades of famines </strong>. The agriculture was destroyed and subsequent cottage industry including the famed muslin of Dacca that villages thrived on. <strong>According to the official British Gazetteer more than 6.7 million Indians died of famines and diseases during 1896 and 1912 </strong>. Since then for the next hundred years hunger has been proverbially associated with Bengalis. Naturally, there was no question of sending out such unfit men abroad for any kind of physical labor. </p>
<p>Once the indentured labor was also outlawed in 1920, there was little migration of Indians till the freedom movement gained momentum. Its leaders went abroad, or in exile or sought political support against the British rule. </p>
<p>After India 's independence in 1947, the British allowed citizens of the British Commonwealth countries (new name of the former British colonies) to emigrate to UK under an employment voucher system. It was drastically curtailed around 1960. Under this scheme thousands of Indians went to UK . </p>
<p>With the 1960 amendment in the US Immigration Act, Indians professionals started coming to USA as the first wave of Indian settlers. <strong>It is a historical event in the sense that for the first time Indians went abroad not only free, but highly respected professionals </strong>. The history continues. </p>
