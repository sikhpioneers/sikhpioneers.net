  <P class=MsoNormal>Any thing associated with Gadar sends a wave of chill in 
    my spine.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN><B>Gadar also symbolizes 
    a dream of some simple brave Indians who thought that once they were out of 
    the British reach in India or other colonies, they could challenge their might.<SPAN
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN></B>But they were politically naïve.<SPAN
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN>The British were able to tap into their overseas 
    activities through the US intelligence and aborted their various plans.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </SPAN>After 25 years of independence and private donation, the Gadar Memorial 
    Center at 5 Wood Street was opened in 1975.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </SPAN>My first visit was in Dec. 2001.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN></P>
  <P class=MsoNormal>Center is located in a small house.<SPAN
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN><B>As I entered its main hall upstairs, I was 
    really overwhelmed by its vibrations.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN></B>Though 
    all alone in the hall, yet I felt surrounded by immortals.<SPAN
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN>At such moments, one realizes the difference 
    between the longevity of a human being in a physical form and legacy left 
    behind with great ideals and sacrifice.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN><B>Nevertheless, 
    the quality of an individual life is always measured by the amelioration brought 
    in all life around.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN></B></P>
  <P class=MsoNormal>At the entrance of the hall, there was a visitor’s register 
    wherein I proudly entered my name.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN>There 
    are 21 framed pictures of the Gadar Party leaders and martyrs on two opposite 
    walls of the main hall.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN>Twenty-two 
    open bookshelves have an assortment of books and four showcases display some 
    Gadar Party material.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN><B>My concern 
    was that with open shelves, no checkout system, and no regular open hours, 
    this collection is likely to be lost and wither away.<SPAN
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN><O:P></O:P></B></P>
  <P class=MsoNormal>While looking at those pictures I felt as if they were also 
    peering at me.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN>It was an eerie feeling 
    that one gets in a cemetery, but I soon got over.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </SPAN>One not aware of their heroic deeds would pay little attention to 
    their ordinary facial features.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN><B>Ordinary 
    people appear extraordinary because of their great deeds and sacrifices.</B><SPAN
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN>I paid my homage to each one by standing before 
    each picture and took notes of whatever I saw or came across my mind.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </SPAN>The dates in parentheses across some names are the dates of their <B>kissing 
    the British gallows.</B><SPAN
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN>The comments in the Italics are mine.<O:P></O:P></P>

      of its institutional models. Since by 1930’s leaders and masses alike were

  <P class=MsoNormal>The Gadar Party was active in all kinds of publications in 
    many languages, and mixing them whenever necessary. That is one lesson to 
    draw. It is a shame that soon after independence so much was damaged in language 
    riots in India<B>. In public service, message and its spirit should not be 
    sacrificed for the sake of language<O:P></O:P></B><O:P></O:P></P>
  <P class=MsoNormal>The current visitor’s register has been maintained since 
    1982. <B>In a random count, I figured that not more than 2000 visitors came 
    during the last 19 years!</B> Included in it are names of some Indian ministers 
    visiting it during their US trips. By and large, visitors are from California 
    who come for the obvious reason of their ancestors’ association with the Gadar 
    Party. After winding up a comprehensive survey of the main hall, I came out 
    in a small lobby. There are five framed posters and a few memorial plaques. 
    Inscribed in plaque are many names including Chief Patron, Didar Singh Bains 
    of Yuba City, I call it a <B>citadel of <I>Punjabiyat</I>, in USA</B>.<O:P></O:P></P>
  <P class=MsoNormal>On a lobby wall a big map of <B>United States of India includes 
    present Pakistan, united Kashmir, Burma, Sri Lanka, and other smaller territories</B>. 
    Two other walls include on its display a framed poster in Urdu appealing to 
    Indians not to fight with the Chinese. My thoughts went to 1950’s when the 
    mood of HINDI CHEENI BHAI BHAI foreign policy turned into a stab in the back 
    by the Chinese assault on Indian in Oct 1962.<O:P></O:P></P>
  <P class=MsoNormal>A photo of the members of freedom fighters for India <B><I>Jatha</I></B> 
    1924 includes a picture of Raja Mahendra Pratap of Vrandaban. All along masses 
    viewed Indian princes as stooges of the British Empire. Reading about him 
    showed that there are always exceptions. <B>For Raja’s opposition to the British 
    policies, he was denied passport to leave India</B>. It is an intriguing story 
    how he reached Germany and joined the German army. The British confiscated 
    all his royal property in India. A framed poster titles: Remember Our Gadar 
    Heroes. Names of the founding members are: Lala Hardyal, Ram Chandra Bhardwaj 
    and Baba Sohan Singh Bhaken. Figures of 400 members hanged during 1915-16 
    and 5000 life imprisoned are noted. It is an awesome feeling to be a part 
    of this history. <B>History is not a cookbook of recipes. Yet, standing up 
    and staking your life for your ideals and values, providing inspiring leadership 
    in crises and working in a united way, are qualities that are always called 
    upon in any age and national crisis</B>.<O:P></O:P></P>
  <P class=MsoNormal>Government of India with the collaboration of overseas Indian 
    communities should establish Gadar Studies Centers in Vancouver (Canada) and 
    London (UK) where the Gadar movement had its wings. The first Indian Ambassador 
    At Large, <B>Dr. Bhishm Agnithotri is ideally positioned to explore such projects 
    with Indian Diaspora</B>. However, the most urgent need it to save the display 
    items from natural decay, mishandling and neglect. <B>The entire collection 
    can be electronically saved on a single hard disc and commercially marketed</B>.<O:P></O:P></P>
  <P class=MsoNormal>PS:<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </SPAN><I>Gadar </I>is 
    an Urdu word adopted in Punjabi also, which is equivalent to the word evolution 
    in English. A traitor in Urdu would be transliterated in English as <I>Gaddaar</I>, 
    which is also adopted in Punjabi language. An English reader must see the 
    big difference in meanings caused by this subtle difference in spelling.<B><SPAN
