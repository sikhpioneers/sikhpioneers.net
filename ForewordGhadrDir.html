<p><strong>The Ghadr Directory, compiled by the Director Intelligence Bureau, Home Department, Government of India, was printed by the Manager, Government of India Press in 1934. It was supposed to be a confidential document of the Intelligence Bureau, containing useful information regarding the persons, involved in the Ghadr movement in America, Europe, Africa, Afghanistan and India. As the printed book (document) was not available for offset printing so we had to depend upon the Photostat copy. The whole matter has been typeset again keeping the uniformity in terms of the pages of the original document.</strong></p>
<p><strong> The Punjabi University takes delight in bringing out the Ghadr Directory in the book form for the first time. We place on record our gratitude towards Mr. Avtar Johl and his friends of Indian Workers&rsquo; Association of Great Britain for making the document available to us.</strong></p>
<p><strong> The Ghadr Directory is a document, having an abiding historical significance. The Imperial powers made use of it for their own specific purposes. For us, in free India, it has a different meaning and thrust. In the present form, it will kindle the imagination of the young generation and arouse their interest in the chronicle of the mighty role that had been played by the hero&rsquo;s of the Ghadr movement in the service of India in bondage. The Ghadr Directory will acquaint many of us with the lives and deeds of those who had symbolized a tremendous passion in the cause of the freedom of India from the foreign yoke.</strong></p>
<p><strong> I trust that the Ghadr Directory will find favour will all those who are votaries of the Ghadrite stream of the Indian Freedom Struggle.</strong></p>
