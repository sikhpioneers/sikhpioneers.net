<H2 align="center">Her Gadar Grandfather </H2>
<P align="left">Rani Johnson, who traced her roots back to an Indian revolutionary 
  talks about her journey to Arthur J. Pais 
<P align="left">Rani Johnson, daughter of an American couple, grew up hearing 
  only a few things about her maternal grandfather. 
<P align="left">But this much she knew: he was a famed Indian revolutionary whose 
  fight against the British took him across the world - to Hong Kong, the Philippines, 
  China, Japan, America and Panama. His exploits included escaping from a British 
  warrant issued in China by hiding in a San Francisco-bound ship laden with cow-hides. 
  He was a master of disguise: he had even fooled a few British officers into 
  thinking he was a Japanese traveler. 
<P align="left">One nugget of information was ingrained in her memory. 
<P align="left">"I am an avid equestrian," she says, "and one of the stories that 
  caught my attention was of him losing an eye on a tree limb as he was riding 
  a horse across who knows where." Her grandmother, whose ancestors had roots 
  in Germany and France, hardly spoke of him. But from her mother, Rani Johnson 
  had a few glimpses into her seemingly mysterious grandfather. 
<P align="left">She knew, for instance, her grandfather Bhai Bhagwan Singh, a 
  Sikh preacher, poet and sometime priest at a Hong Kong gurdwara, practiced yoga. 
  "I believe he began the day with a headstand to increase the flow of blood to 
  the head," she says. "Apart from a few bits of information I knew nothing about 
  my Indian side," she continues. "Of course, I was given an Indian name as an 
  acknowledgement of my Indian connections but that was all." 
<P align="left">Now that she has located a cousin and met him a few weeks ago, 
  she feels like a fuller person, she says. 
<P align="left">Soon after graduation from Brown University about three years 
  ago, Johnson took one or two history classes at a Rhode Island college, and 
  that's where she began dwelling on her Indian grandfather. "I was taking classes 
  be-cause I have always been interested in history," she says with a laugh. But 
  she feels she was mysteriously being directed towards something more interesting. 
<P align="left">"I asked a couple of professors where I could get information 
  on the Gadaris who had started a revolutionary movement in North America to 
  fight for India's independence in the early part of the last century," she recalls. 
  "I wanted to know more about my grandfather - and more important, to trace his 
  family in India." She had a very strong urge to connect with her Indian family, 
  she says. The professors directed Johnson to history department at Stanford 
  and University of California at Berkeley, where a lot of material on the Gadar 
  movement exists. [Editor note: Professor actually directed her to Dr. Karen 
  Leonard, professor at the University of California, Irvine, who has done lots 
  of work on Punjabi Pioneers.]
<P align="left">Johnson was not alone in the quest. 
<P align="left">Unknown to her, Bhagwan Singh's family in India - he had left 
  behind a wife and three children - was also trying to find out about his American 
  daughter Bebe and her family. For many years Surinder Pal Singh, one of Bhagwan 
  Singh's Indian grandsons who had migrated to America in the mid-1970s and settled 
  in Atlanta, was searching for the other branch of the family. He had contacted 
  academics and community leaders to gather more information about his grandfather's 
  'American wife.' 
<P align="left">Finally, he came across Ted Sibia, a librarian who maintains a 
  terrific website on Punjabis in America and the Gadarites (www.lib.ucdavis.edu/punjab). 
<P align="left">"The contacts I made through this site led me finally to my cousin 
  Rani," Surinder says. "Suddenly, I discovered we were not worlds apart." For 
  Johnson, her mother Bebe and Surinder Singh, May 31 was a stirring day as they 
  met for the first time in Santa Clara, California, at the 90th anniversary celebration 
  of the Gadar movement. 
<P align="left">The next day Johnson read a paper about her search and narrated 
  how the two families had discovered each other a few weeks before the May 31 
  event. Surinder Singh, who is working on a biography of her grandfather, reminisced 
  about Bhagwan Singh who had become the second president of the Gadar Party in 
  1914 and had inspired hundreds of rebels. Like some of the more prominent Gadarites, 
  Bhagwan Singh too had served time in an American jail because of his subversive 
  activities. 
<P align="left">"There are a few people like me who want to keep the legacy of 
  these selfless and brave people alive," he says. "And discovering family members 
  in American will also help in doing that." He says there were reasons why the 
  two families knew very little of each other. "My grandfather's American marriage 
  was very short lived," he says with a sigh. He does not want to speak more about 
  it, he adds, but it wasn't a very happy union. 
<P align="left">What kind of marriage was it? Didn't Bhagwan Singh leave behind 
  his wife and three children in India? "You know how things were in those years 
  with the revolutionaries," Surinder Singh says. When Bhagwan Singh returned 
  to India for good in 1958, his wife had died. 
<P align="left">"My grandmother and the immediate members of the family had been 
  hunted and even physically tortured by the British who wanted to find out which 
  part of the world Grandfather was," the grandson says, "because he often went 
  underground to avoid being arrested." Johnson says she had always thought her 
  maternal cousins and uncles would be in India. 
<P align="left">"I was stunned, and I was surprised to know at least one member 
  of the family has been living in America for nearly three decades," she says. 
  Through Surinder, Johnson hopes to learn more about her grandfather and the 
  Gadar movement. "I have started reading some of my grandfather's writings," 
  she says, "and I find an eerie familiarity with his thinking, even though I 
  never met him. I now feel I am spiritually connected with him." 
<P align="left">"It almost seems surreal at times," she says with a chuckle. "But 
  all things must happen for a reason."
