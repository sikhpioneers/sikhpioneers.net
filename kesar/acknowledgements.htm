<P>Since 1963, we have traveled almost every year from East to West and North to 
South to cover the North American Continent. We used to travel by car about five 
to six thousand miles during summer vacation. We went from one city to another, 
from one home to another in search of material connected with our research.</P>
<P>Bhai Charan Singh Sandhu, village Badhana (Lahore) of Calipatria, California 
who landed at San Francisco port in 1910, very kindly became our guide and 
introduced us to several pioneers and their families in California, Arizona, 
Oregon and Washington States. He was the member of Ghadr Party Commission.</P>
<P>In Canada while traveling from Halifax to Vancouver in 1964, we had an 
opportunity to meet a great pioneer Baba Sohan Singh Bhullar of Edmonton 
(Alberta), the first secretary of Khalsa Diwan Society, Victoria (1912).</P>
<P>With the help and guidance of Giani Hardial Singh Mann, the Head Priest of 
Akali Singh Temple, Vancouver we had opportunities to interview Baba Naranjan 
Singh Thauli, Baba Surain Singh Mohim and Baba Bachan Singh Dhillon, Sur Singh 
and some other pioneers and their families.</P>
<P>Sohan Surindar Singh Sangha of Vancouver, very kindly arranged our interview 
with Baba Amanat-Ali-Khan, a great pioneer and father of Riasat Ali Khan.</P>
<P>Bhair Harbhajan Singh Manhas long-time secretary of the Khalsa Diwan Society, 
Paldi, Vancouver Island, introduced us to Baba Natara Singh Barn, a poet and a 
pioneer of the second group of immigrants.</P>
<P>Baba Nand Singh Langroa himself a pioneer arranged our interview with Bibi 
Mohindar Kaur of Abbotsford. He came to Canada in 1924.</P>
<P>If we go on writing the names of the pioneers and friends who helped us in 
our research, there will be no end to it.</P>
<P>Still we would like to mention the names of some of the people, who helped us 
one way or other – some of them provided us with documents and material and some 
others helped us to provided us with group and individual photographs. We are 
very thankful to the following friends who helped us in our research:</P>
