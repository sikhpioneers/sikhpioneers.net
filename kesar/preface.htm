<b>
SIKH TRADITIONS – SANGAT IS SUPREME</b></CENTER>
<br>
<p>The constitution of Khalsa Diwan Society, Vancouver, does not say anything about the election of the Granthi (priest) of the Khalsa Diwan Society, Vancouver, does not say anything aobut the election of the Granthi (priest) of the Khalsa Diwan Society but it became part of the tradition after the unanimous election of Bhai Balwant Singh as a first priest of the first Sikh Temple on the soil of North American continent. 

<p>The office bearers of the Khalsa Diwan Society, Vancouver were elected by majority votes but the Granthi by the unanimous vote of the Supreme Sangat (people). 

<p>The unanimously elected granthi was considered above the Management Committee of the Sikh Temple. Only Supreme Sangat could relieve him from his services. 

<p>Prof. Teja Singh was a great intellectual who helped the immigrants from India not to be pushed to British Honduras and won the fight against racism. He was the leader of the Ottawa deputation. When the question arised that who should lead the Sikh deputation to England and India, Prof. Teja Singh’s name came up again. Then the Supreme Sangat decided that unanimously elected individual should lead the deputation. Prof. Teja Singh could not win the unanimous vote and he withdrew his name.

<p>Some other names were suggested but no one could get the approval of the Sangat.

<p>Bhai Balwant Singh’s name came up and the Sangat elected him unanimously. He humbly requested that highly educated individual should be the leader to present the grievances of our community to the governments of England and India but he had to bow to the order of the Sangat.
<p>
 

1)      Bhai Waryam Singh should officiate as a Granthi in his absence.<br>

2)      The Management Committee should not be changed until the deputation returns from India.<br>

 

<p>His both requests were granted by the Sangat.

<p>The  Khalsa Diwan Society, Vancouver had branches in Abbotsford, Victoria and New Westminster. The Granthis from these temples were nominated by  Vancouver management committee with the consent of the local committees.
<p>
At the time of the Akali Movement in India, Bhai Bhagwan Singh Dosanjh was the president of the Khalsa Diwan Society of Vancouver. The question came up again that the new Granthi should be elected unanimously. The three different factions of society had three candidates due to unemployment and poor economical conditions. Nobody was elected unanimously. Then Bhai Bhagwan Singh offered his own services and suggested that he should officiate as a  Granthi without salary and will continue working in the mill if Sangat approves. His request was granted unanimously.

<p>It seems that after Bhai Bhagwan Singh left with the Shaheedi Jatha to  take part in the Akali Movement, the tradition was changed, with the change of times and the management Committee was authorized to hire the future priests.

<p><center><b>SIKH ORGANIZATION</center></b>
<p>Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, Amritsar was born after the Sikhs of Vancouver and British Columbia had their own organization of Khalsa Diwan Society. They had their headquarters and their branches, controlled and managed by the headquarter with the consent of the local-elected-committees. Two members of the each branch were included in the Management Committee of the Khalsa Society of Vancouver. It was a real democratic set-up.  Local committees were never over ruled by the heaquarter. 

<p>When the S.G.P.C., Amritsar was organized, Bhai Mit Singh Pandori, the General Secretary of the Khalsa Diwan Society of Vancouver, at the time of the Komagata Maru crisis, was elected as a member of the executive committee  of the first       S.G.P.C., Amritsar as a representative of the Khalsa Diwan Society of Vancouver.<br><br>

<CENTER><b>UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD</CENTER></b>

<p>Although the Khalsa Diwan Society was organized by the Sikhs but Hindus and Muslims were part of the community. Upper part of the temple was used for religious congregations. Hindus and Muslims also attended the congregations.
<p>They had their common kitchen (Guru Ka Langar) managed by the Khalsa Diwan Society but they ate together. There was no discrimination. Rules of Universal Brotherhood were practiced.

<p>The lower hall was used as a meeting place. The Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims had the same economical, social and political problems. They discussed their grievances and problems in these meetings.

<p>If in one meeting, Bhag Singh was elected to chair the meeting, next time the chairman was Hassan Rahim or Mohd. Akbar and in another gathering Sohan Lal was asked to chair the meeting. Everyone had a right to express his own opinion. This was the beginning of the Indian Labour Union.<br>

 <br>

<CENTER><b>LOHRI (BONFIRE) OF SLAVERY</CENTER></b>

 

<p>Among Indian immigrants more than 90% were Sikhs and majority of them were ex-soldiers. They had their uniforms, medals of bravery and letters of recommendations from their British Officers. They were proud to dress-up in their uniforms, hanging their medals on their chests and carrying letters in their pockets. Very soon, they were made to realize that their uniforms, medals and letters had no value at all.

<p>Racial discrimination was prevalent. White settlers of the country hated non-Whites
On October 3rd, 1909, in the end of the religious assembly, Bhai Natha Singh asked for permission to speak. He said “our uniforms and medals show that we have fought for the British as mercenaries against our own countrymen and to enslave other Asian nations. The uniforms and medals are the symbols of our slavery. I propose that no member of the executive Sikh Temple should wear any kind of medals, buttons, uniforms or insignias which may signify that the position of the party wearing the article is nothing but a slave to the British supremacy.
<p>Bhai Garib Singh, Vice President of the society accepted his proposal. He himself was a sepay 2760 in the 14th Sikh regiment. He had fought in China during the Boxer trouble and had acquired a medal of chivalry. He took off his medal and promised that, he would not wear any medal or uniform.
<p>Bhai Bhag Singh, the secretary of the Khalsa Diwan Society had served in the 10th Bengal Lancer regiment for five years, made a bonfire with his uniforms, medals and their photographs. They called it Lohri (bonfire) of slavery.
<p>This was the beginning of the revolution for the freedom of motherland, thousands of miles away from India.<br><br>

<br>
<center><b>TWO MAIN PROBLEMS</b></center><br>
<p>Every Sunday afternoon Indian immigrants held their religious congregation and after that they had their meeting to discuss their day to day problems.  Two of their following imminent problems were discusses in every meeting.

<p>1.      How to bring their families?

<p>2.      The problem of the ‘Direct Passage’.

 


<p>Non-British subjects – Chinese and Japanese were allowed to have their families with them, but not Indians.

 


<p>The order-in-council required that: “All immigrants seeking entry must come to Canada by continuous journey and on through tickets from the country of their birth or nationality or citizenship.”


<p>This order-in-council was passed intentionally to stop the entry of immigrants from India.  The minister who wrote this order-in-council knew that there was not any ship sailing from any Indian port to Canada.


<p>During one of the Sunday meetings some one suggested that they let us have our own ship to sail from Calcutta to Vancouver to defeat this order-in-council.  At that time nobody took this suggestion seriously but people began dreaming of having our own ship to sail from Calcutta to Vancouver.


<p>Since 1911 the Indian immigrants have been dreaming to own a ship but the press of British Columbia laughed at their idea.


<p>It seems that Bhai Balwant Singh took it seriously.  When Bhai Bhag Singh and Bhai Balwant Singh were stranded at Hong Kong for months, they continuously talked about having their own ship but their first priority was to reach Vancouver with their families.


<p>When Bhai Balwant Singh lead deputation to India in1913, he discussed his idea of owning or hiring a ship from Calcutta to Vancouver.  He traveled all over Punjab and discusses this idea with Bhai Takhat Singh, manager of Kanyan Mahan Vidyala, Ferozepur.  He was a great help to Bhai Balwant Singh.


<p>At Lyallpur, he discussed this idea with Sardar Harchand Singh.  Bhai Dewa Singh, secretary of the Singh Sabha Amritsar and a very prominent preacher Bhai Budh Singh Updeshak encouraged him and offered their help.  Then he visited Tarn Taran and met Bhai Mohan Singh Vaid.


<p>When he visited Ferozepur the second time, he was very pleased to know that Bhai Gurdit Singh Slandia (Seranda Malaya) had taken up this project very seriously.  Bhai Takhat Singh introduced his secretary Daljit Singh and assistant secretary Vir Singh to Bhai Balwant Singh and told him that they were ready to assist Gurdit Singh in his project.


<p>Bhai Balwant Singh gave Daljit Singh, names and addresses of prominent Indian residents of Vancouver and Victoria, B.C.


<p>These two youngmen wanted to go to Canada for higher studies.  It was not a coincident that when Gurdit Singh chartered Komagata Maru, Daljit Singh and Vir Singh were already in Hong Kong and both of them were appointed secretary and assistant secretaries for this project.


<p>Icemonger and Stallery authors of Ghadar Conspiracy Report write: “It will be remembered that at this time the Indian deputation from Canada was in the Panjab and it is curious to find that when Gurdit Singh returned to Hong Kong and chartered his ship, he was joined by an individual named Daljit Singh, who just prior to this was assistant editor of the ‘Panjabee Bhain’, a monthly publication devoted to the subjects of female education and the official organ of the Sikh Kanayan Mahan Vidyala (Sikh girls’ school) at Ferozepur.  The latter institution is managed by Takhat Singh by whom the delegates were entertained when they visited Ferozepur.  Daljit Singh became Gurdit Singh’s secretary and subsequently took a prominent part in all his doings.”


<p>Records show that Bhai Balwant Singh picked up five of his friends from his village Khurd Pur and sent them to Hong Kong to board Komagata Maru for Vancouver.


<p>“At Yokohama, they (passengers of Komagata Maru) were met by Balwant Singh who was then on his way to Vancouver...” (Icemonger and Stallery).


<p>Bhai Balwant Singh and Bhai Gurdit Singh traveled by train from Yokohama to Kobe and then back to Yokohama.


<p>Before Bhai Balwant Singh left Japan for Canada by another ship, Daljit Singh gave him a list of passengers including their names, villages and districts.


<p>As soon as he reached Vancouver, he produced a very large poster giving all the details about passengers.


<p>During the crisis of Komagata Maru, Bhai Balwant Singh was the main speaker during mass meetings.


<p>To charter a ship was the brain-child of Bhai Balwant Singh and Bhai Gurdit Singh was the hero who put it into practice.
