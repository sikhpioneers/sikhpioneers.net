The word Panjab is a combination of two words- PANJ and AB, PANJ means five and AB means water- The land of five rivers.

<p>After the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the Lion of Punjab, the Sikh forces were divided into several factions. Even then General Sham Singh Attari fought vigorously but could not face the heavy artillery of the British. After the martyrdom of Sadar Sham Singh Attari in 1846, the Sikh forces were defeated and Panjab became the part of British Empire.</p>
<p>A prominent British statesmen in India was asked a question by a British reporter – why the brave Sikh forces have been defeated so easily? He replied, “You know that they lost their leader. When they don’t have a strong leader every one of them becomes a leader. Nobody wants to be a follower.”</p>
<p>After the capture of Punjab the British became the rulers of India from north to south and east to west. Thousands of defeated Sikh soldiers were still a threat for the British. They hatched a scheme to employ them in their forces for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
   <li>To avoid the threat of defeated Sikh soldiers in Panjab and </li>
   <li>To use them in their new colonies – Burma, Malaya, Hongkong and part of China, Shanghai and Canton as soldiers and police force</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of these soldiers belonged to the families of small land holders. To force these farmers to become part of the British forces, the government played a trick. They raised the taxes on their lands and lowered the rates of their produce-grains, cotton and sugarcane etc. They were forced to take loans from the money-lenders to save their small pieces of lands. When they could not pay their loans, they were left with one option only- to sell their land and become landless and homeless and work as farm labourers.</p>
<p>Driven by poverty and hunger those farm soldiers were forced to enroll themselves in the British Indian forces. The British used these Sikh soldiers to crush the First War of Independence in 1857. British ruled over Burma with the help of Sikh soldiers. The King of Burma was imprisoned and slapped by these Sikh soldiers and he was deported to India where he lived in prison upto his last day of life.</p>
<p>The same treatment was given to Bahadur Shan, the King of India. He was taken to Rangoon (Burma) where he died of hunger and poverty.</p>
<p>In Malaya these soldiers were used to defeat the Malaya Sultans and in China they were used against the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Although these soldiers were treated as slaves but at the same time they were economically better off than their compatriots living in Punjab. To copy these slave Sikh soldiers, the new generation of Sikh farmers followed them to foreign lands.</p>
<p>All the British colonies of East Asia were ruled by the assistance of these Sikh soldiers.</p>
